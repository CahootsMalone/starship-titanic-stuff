198 | 749 | 748 | Won't she?
199 | 751 | 750 | Won't he?
200 | 753 | 752 | Does he?

205 | 763 | 762 | Is that right?
206 | 765 | 764 | My goodness.
207 | 767 | 766 | Well bless my soul.
208 | 1029 | 1028 | Now who'd drink an old soldier like me?
209 | 993 | 992 | Afraid duty would not permit it.
210 | 1047 | 1046 | Well, they're films.
211 | 1021 | 1020 | Masses. Forgotten it all, though.
212 | 1069 | 1068 | You trying to get me shot?!
213 | 953 | 952 | Never had time for that sort of thing. Frippery. Too busy soldiering.
214 | 961 | 960 | Ah well that's all down to a matter of taste, as my old C. O. said, it would be a sad world if we was all alike.
215 | 951 | 950 | Never had time for that sort of thing.
216 | 959 | 958 | Take it or leave it.
217 | 995 | 994 | Only inadvertently.
218 | 1025 | 1024 | Knew a bloke as did.
219 | 1011 | 1010 | Lethally so in my younger day.
220 | 1015 | 1014 | I suppose it depends on the lightbulb.
221 | 981 | 980 | Memory's a blank.
222 | 1067 | 1066 | Ah, that's more than my job's worth.
223 | 1041 | 1040 | Never took anything. Always paid my way.
224 | 969 | 968 | Don't really get the opportunity, what with being embedded in this personal transportation device and unprovided with such diversions.
225 | 973 | 972 | Not as such, though it's not for me to say.
226 | 991 | 990 | Not exactly.
227 | 1051 | 1050 | Not for me to say.
228 | 967 | 966 | Don't get much time for that in my job.
229 | 997 | 996 | No time for them.
230 | 977 | 976 | Not in a literal sense.
231 | 987 | 986 | Not to speak of.
232 | 1035 | 1034 | Not to speak of.
233 | 1073 | 1072 | No way. No way. Can't be done. No, no, definitely no. If you take my meaning.
234 | 971 | 970 | Only in that sense of the word.
235 | 1005 | 1004 | Everyone to their own opinion.
236 | 1037 | 1036 | Probably, but it was dark.
237 | 1003 | 1002 | Ah well I'm glad you asked that it's an interesting question I often wonder the same thing myself but do you know in all the time I've been here which isn't long although it seems like ages although I wouldn't know, ages being what they are, which I have to say is not what they used to be, where was I, rambling again, tsk tsk tsk. . . no.
238 | 1007 | 1006 | Ah well, rubbish is as rubbish does.
239 | 957 | 956 | Can't rightly recall. It's this Asgon's Tregeriasis. Plays havoc with your. . . what's it called? Never mind.
240 | 965 | 964 | No, now that's where you're lucky to have your borms intact, you see, because if your borms isn't intact you has difficulty in what you might call actually liking anything.
241 | 955 | 954 | Can't rightly recall.
242 | 963 | 962 | Makes me feel poorly just to think about it.
243 | 989 | 988 | Well yes. And no. In a manner of speaking.
244 | 1039 | 1038 | Soldiers don't try. They succeed.
245 | 1045 | 1044 | Ah, well, there you are then.
246 | 1075 | 1074 | Ummm...

248 | 1049 | 1048 | Very fine if you like that sort of thing.
249 | 1043 | 1042 | Watch your mouth.
250 | 1013 | 1012 | Had one once but the wheel came off.
251 | 1001 | 1000 | Wondering the same thing myself.
252 | 985 | 984 | That's your privilege.

432 | 1369 | 1368 | Nah, Sir, he's one of them Pontinentals, not like you or me, takes it all very personal, gets right overheated, specially if you argue with him, one day he's going to do himself a fatal if you follow my meaning.
433 | 1377 | 1376 | Not so bad.
434 | 1395 | 1394 | Bit chronic, tell you the truth.
435 | 1379 | 1378 | Can't complain.
436 | 1381 | 1380 | Could complain but won't.
437 | 1383 | 1382 | Don't ask.
438 | 1385 | 1384 | Aching borms, Sir; aching borms.
439 | 1387 | 1386 | Blibber acting up, Sir.

443 | 1239 | 1238 | You will find the lift floor indicator just behind you, Sir.
444 | 1405 | 1404 | That must be fascinating, Sir.

450 | 1459 | 1458 | Still worrying about that bomb, are we, Sir?
451 | 1471 | 1470 | Bomb, Sir? Not the sort of thing we'd have on this ship.
452 | 1461 | 1460 | Wouldn't let that bomb prey on your mind, Sir.
453 | 1473 | 1472 | Bomb, Sir? Nobody mentioned a bomb to me.
454 | 1463 | 1462 | My advice, Sir, is relax and don't even think about the bomb.
455 | 1475 | 1474 | Bomb. Sir? Lost me arm on account of a bomb, I think I'd know if there was one on board.
456 | 1407 | 1406 | Well, yes, it would be. Just as mine would be RSM Nobbingt. . no, just call me Nobby.
457 | 1503 | 1502 | My pleasure.
458 | 1505 | 1504 | Don't mention it.
459 | 1507 | 1506 | It's my job, Sir.
460 | 1509 | 1508 | Nothing to it.
461 | 1341 | 1340 | And what floor would that be, Sir?
462 | 1343 | 1342 | Ah well, Sir, now that's what your PET is for, Designer Room Number Mode, whatever that means.
463 | 1403 | 1402 | I am sure I will be able to say the same in due course, Sir.
464 | 1345 | 1344 | Not now, Sir, I'm working.
465 | 1363 | 1362 | Quick march!
466 | 1365 | 1364 | Present arms!
467 | 1347 | 1346 | Yes, Sir. You have my full attention.
468 | 1349 | 1348 | Can't be done Sir, as a cursory inspection would indicate.
469 | 1351 | 1350 | Very funny, Sir. Very droll.
470 | 1353 | 1352 | Can't be done, Sir.
471 | 1355 | 1354 | Right, Sir. Halted. What now?
472 | 1357 | 1356 | Sprinklers'll take care of that, Sir.
473 | 1359 | 1358 | At ease soldier.
474 | 1361 | 1360 | Attention!
475 | 1229 | 1228 | There are 39 floors, but this lift only goes to floor 27.
476 | 1227 | 1226 | There are 39 floors.
477 | 1101 | 1100 | Don't see no point in that line of questioning.
478 | 1119 | 1118 | I've been trying to rack my brain about that myself, Sir. Trouble is, it doesn't seem to rack like it used to.
479 | 1121 | 1120 | Way outside my limited parameters of operational competence, that sort of thing.
480 | 1103 | 1102 | You wot? You wot? You wot?
481 | 1105 | 1104 | You WOT?
482 | 1107 | 1106 | Not with you.

484 | 1111 | 1110 | Why there?
485 | 1113 | 1112 | Don't know nothing about that, Sir.
486 | 1115 | 1114 | Need to know basis, that, Sir.
487 | 1117 | 1116 | That sort of thing is down to successful hintellectuals like yourself, Sir.
488 | 1077 | 1076 | Which is a mood point given my wossname. Condition.
489 | 1079 | 1078 | Though seeing as I can hardly move what with my blibber and all. . . well, say no more, that's my motto.
490 | 1081 | 1080 | I just hope the experience'll limber me up, given me state of health.
491 | 1083 | 1082 | Though don't be surprised if I disintegrate with sheer agonizing agony.
492 | 1085 | 1084 | Even if I die in the attempt.
493 | 1087 | 1086 | Though having said that, it's the last thing on my mind, which is a mere blur of pain.
494 | 1089 | 1088 | And I'm glad one of us is in a state of health to give consideration to such matters.
495 | 1091 | 1090 | And may I say I wish I could think about things like that. Or like anything. But the agony, Sir; the raw majestic agony...

505 | 1225 | 1224 | Doesn't exist. Thirty-nine floors - that's your lot. Like it or lump it.

516 | 1613 | 1612 | Music, eh? They got music onboard, in the. . . now where would it be. . . the Music Room, I think, though I may be wrong.
517 | 1615 | 1614 | Often fancied going into music myself, Sir, except I didn't have the talent or the interest.
518 | 1621 | 1620 | Well stap me vitals.

523 | 1631 | 1630 | Spouter on the starboard bow!
524 | 1599 | 1598 | Where would we be without science, Sir? At home, with our feet up, I expect.
525 | 1601 | 1600 | Got a lot of respect for science, me. Something. . . scientific about it, know what I mean?
526 | 1603 | 1602 | I'd heard they do a bit of science on Earth.
527 | 1331 | 1330 | Sorry, Sir... not as nimble as I used to be.
528 | 1333 | 1332 | Sorry Sir. . . not so spry as I was.
529 | 1335 | 1334 | Sorry Sir. . . but there's nothing so urgent you can't take your time.
530 | 1337 | 1336 | Sorry Sir. . . but slow-but-sure, that's my motto.
531 | 1339 | 1338 | Sorry Sir. . . but steady does it.
532 | 1605 | 1604 | You been hanging around with that Digital Village lot, then? Very distinguished, I must say.
533 | 1589 | 1588 | Ere! Less of that!
534 | 1591 | 1590 | Oy! Wash your mouth out with soap!
535 | 1593 | 1592 | Drop it, Sir. . . knock it orf.
536 | 1595 | 1594 | Watch your lip.
537 | 1597 | 1596 | Don't come that sort of talk with me.
538 | 1607 | 1606 | See you're a bit of a reading man, Sir. You might enjoy a chat with that filthy parrot.
539 | 1633 | 1632 | Sorry, but the TLA server is down.
540 | 1579 | 1578 | eh?
541 | 1581 | 1580 | Sorry?
542 | 1583 | 1582 | Speak up.

545 | 1491 | 1490 | Thank you.
546 | 1493 | 1492 | Very kind.
547 | 1495 | 1494 | Most obliging.
548 | 1497 | 1496 | You're a gent, Sir.
549 | 1499 | 1498 | Very decent of you and all.
550 | 1501 | 1500 | All in a day's work.
551 | 1299 | 1298 | Yes, the Arboretum. Trees, if memory serves; a very seasonal place in a manner of speaking.
552 | 1305 | 1304 | Ah well, now you're talking, Sir, bit of a jar, few tinctures, just the one, that's the ticket, bit merry, one over the eight, three sheets in the wind not to mention legless, terrible night, whirly pit, regret it in the morning, never again, sign the pledge, I'd come with you, Sir, but I'm nailed to my post.
553 | 1307 | 1306 | Don't envy you that, Sir, not the bilges, all that. . . bilge and what have you, though very nice bilge it is, as bilge goes.
554 | 1301 | 1300 | Lovely canal, Sir, if you can tolerate the singing; and I speak as one who knows canals.
555 | 1303 | 1302 | They do say, Sir, as how music soothes the bosom, Sir, though I haven't noticed it myself.
556 | 1297 | 1296 | Very nice food they do there, too, Sir, if you happen to like nice food.
557 | 1237 | 1236 | Top of the well.
558 | 1747 | 1746 | Top of the Well.
559 | 1791 | 1790 | the battle of bin-j'Jabbli, you may have heard me mention that, carnage it was, carnage and suffering. And anguish. Carnage, suffering and anguish. Sometimes you got carnage. Other times you got anguish. Other times you got suffering. Sometimes you got a mixture. Carnage and suffering. Carnage and anguish. Anguish and suffering. Anguish and carnage. Anguish, suffering and carnage. Begin to get the picture? Best years of my life.
560 | 1793 | 1792 | that day at Phlegnos, the Balneans grouped above us on the commanding heights of the Pelopennopolopoulos, General Shatton with his borms shot to ribbons, you could hear his blibber raggling from half a bile away, anyway, down come the Balneans uttering their horrible war cry of "Ere. Wotch your step" and striking horror into every man's allenoids, WHOMP! they went URGH! SPLOD! TWANG! yuss, it was all scribble and tink and hello cor blimey, until all of a sudden I got my head shot orft and everything went not so much black as a rather effeminate purple but you get what your given in this life, that's my motto, what's your motto, same as mine I expect, wouldn't be surprised, young buggers, what do you do, nuffink, right? Right. End of story.
561 | 1795 | 1794 | Wimpers, a battle as was seared in the remembery of everyone what fought and died there. . . pointless it was, thrumping about in the splod, up to your queeg in albol and flard with the Snazzis ranged on every corner and poor old General Perman with his ob clamped shut and everything all wet and eably, the only word for it was "hardihosh" but we didn't care, we was fighting troops and "Mmmppph" says General Perlman through his clamped ob and off we charged, mown down in waves, it was a massacre but I'll tell you wot, we enjoyed it.
562 | 1797 | 1796 | down in the devastation of Hadjadji, desert country of course and sodden. Sodden. Sodden it was. Sodden, and the sinkimutts up to the top of your wope and your doings jammed - we had Heckler & Kock & Snartigern & Eably & Erasthidmites & Eably's Cousin's Friend Nerick point four-five calibre wossnames, which was always prone to blogging, but what we done, we waved them at the tribesmen and when they saw them they thought to themselves (and you could see them thinking it because Johnny Tribesman has never been any good at disguising his emotions) they thought, blimey, HKSWWWCFN . 45 calibre wossnames, and charged across the burning devastation and massacred us to the last man, but was we downhearted? No. It was OUR IDEA OF FUN.
563 | 1799 | 1798 | Blobberlobberlop. . . a massacre, that was, seeing as how we'd not been properly trained, you see wee was used to other conditions, bin-j-Jabbli, Wimpers, Hadjadji, Phlegnos, that was the terrain we'd been trained for, flat mountainous parched sodden muddy sand and sheer icy rock baking in the fetid jungle heat. But Blobberlobberlop was something different, so when the Blobberlobberloppi came flubberlubberlubberling along, well, we was hacked to pieces, not a man left standing, but we didn't bear a grudge, no, nothing personal, we was fighting men, and a premature agonizing death in a meaningless conflict engineered by imbecilic politicians and greedy arms dealers, werl, that was what we was trained for, soo? It was meat and drink to us.
564 | 1775 | 1774 | Madhouse, it was,
565 | 1777 | 1776 | Nightmare, it was,
566 | 1779 | 1778 | Course you wouldn't remember, but
567 | 1781 | 1780 | Can hardly bear to talk about it, but
568 | 1783 | 1782 | It's not something I like to chat about, casual-like, but
569 | 1785 | 1784 | Reminds me of wossname,
570 | 1787 | 1786 | Funny you should say that, but it takes me back to, what,
571 | 1789 | 1788 | War stories.
572 | 1231 | 1230 | That's just the way it is, Sir.
573 | 1397 | 1396 | I have no doubt you are correct, Sir.
574 | 1399 | 1398 | Don't have time for fripperies like that, Sir.
575 | 1401 | 1400 | Course it is, Sir; this is the Starship Titanic.
576 | 1275 | 1274 | Fraid that's on a need-to-know basis Sir. . . but since you need to know, it's exactly the same as an elevator, Sir, except bent. Inasmuch as it goes up-and-down in a crabwise fashion, Sir. Sideways, as you might say.
577 | 1447 | 1446 | Cellpoint settings, Sir, control my mood in all its rich complexity.
578 | 1647 | 1646 | Elevator - it's a kind of lift, Sir.
579 | 1649 | 1648 | Lift - it's a kind of elevator, Sir.
580 | 1367 | 1366 | A nasty disease, Sir. Spread by them filthy parrots. Eradicate the lot of them, that's what I says.
581 | 1529 | 1528 | It's high time you got a move on.
582 | 1531 | 1530 | It's "now". You'd better hurry before it's "too late".
583 | 1533 | 1532 | Never.
584 | 1535 | 1534 | Immediately.
585 | 1537 | 1536 | Right away.
586 | 1539 | 1538 | Soon.
587 | 1541 | 1540 | Later.
588 | 1543 | 1542 | Earlier.
589 | 1545 | 1544 | Just missed it.
590 | 1547 | 1546 | If you hurry you might just make it.
591 | 1549 | 1548 | Whenever you like.
592 | 1413 | 1412 | If you means where should it be, directly astern, Sir. If you means where it actually is, your guess is as good as mine.
593 | 1433 | 1432 | See if you can guess, Sir. BarBot? BAR Bot? That's right, Sir! The Bar.
594 | 1437 | 1436 | Skiving off and gossiping, I imagine, Sir. Just call him on your PET.
595 | 1431 | 1430 | Marsinta? Embarkation Lobby, generally speaking.
596 | 1435 | 1434 | DoorBot? Just call him on your PET.
597 | 1429 | 1428 | Werl. . . here, Sir.
598 | 1553 | 1552 | Militarily speaking, the obvious target is often the right one. In this case, the Bar.
599 | 1551 | 1550 | Call me old-fashioned, Sir, but I'd try the restaurant.
600 | 1427 | 1426 | No, Sir, it works the other way round: you tell me that, Sir.
601 | 1425 | 1424 | No mystery about that, Sir. It's just what we call "a mystery".
602 | 1411 | 1410 | Vastan, Sir, as soon as a slight positional uncertainty has been resolved.
603 | 1409 | 1408 | Conveniently located, Sir. "Conveniently". . . gettit? Never mind.
604 | 1511 | 1510 | Up and down.
605 | 1513 | 1512 | Here and there.
606 | 1515 | 1514 | This and that.
607 | 1517 | 1516 | Just going along in my rut.
608 | 1519 | 1518 | So so.
609 | 1521 | 1520 | Comme ci comme ca.
610 | 1523 | 1522 | I've had my ups and downs.
611 | 1525 | 1524 | Nothing special.
612 | 1527 | 1526 | Nowhere special.
613 | 1419 | 1418 | Nothing, Sir. Nothing at all. Just a temporary non-reversible dysfuctionality, to use the military term. You'd probably call it "busted", Sir.
614 | 1417 | 1416 | Not a lot of help, Sir. I mean, we may know where we are, but we don't know where 'where we are' is.
615 | 1809 | 1808 | Some sort of floor you wanted was it?
616 | 1807 | 1806 | Floor?
617 | 1805 | 1804 | I expect you'll be wanting a - oooooh! Floor.
618 | 1801 | 1800 | Starlight Lines.
619 | 1803 | 1802 | The Starship Titanic.
620 | 1811 | 1810 | Where to or what is it then?
621 | 1819 | 1818 | Your allenoids. . . your allenoids. . . werl, your allenoids, see, they sort of feed your splanck. Drip drip drip. Blibber fluids. Allenoid goes up the spout, you starve your splanck of blibber fluids and it's next stop, Asgon's Tregeriasis.
622 | 1835 | 1834 | Very complicated system, the anphosterous system, very complicated and complex. A kind of a. . . system, really, governed by the workings of the anphosterous wossname, which supervises, gland, anphosterous gland, that's the word. Supervises. . . well, supervises the anphosterous system, protects your splank, stimulates your wabs, that kind of thing.
623 | 1823 | 1822 | Blimey, all I can say is, I hope you never find out about aphoritis. I've been a martyr to aphoritis all my born days, starts in the allenoids and worms its way along to the borms, and then you've had it, you're a husk, the doctors is baffled, sticking things in your caprifornium, numb blebs, the lot.
624 | 1831 | 1830 | Arthusia? Werl, if you're unlucky enough to get a wound, as it might be a war-wound as a result of valiant military action in the face of overwheleming odds, and this war-wound happens to be in your, you know, bazonium. . . well, next thing you know, you're sitting - painfully - in the surgery while the doc is saying "Yeah, right, Nobby, what you got is Arthusia and there's nothink we can do".
625 | 1821 | 1820 | Asgon's tregeriasis? Horible, that is. Wouldn't wish it on a wossname. You don't want to get Asgon's tregeriasis, Sir, Madam or Thing, not if you're given the chance. Worse than aphoritis, it is. Someone comes up to you, says "Here, d'you fancy Asgon's tregeriasis?" you just punch them in the blibber and run for it.
626 | 1833 | 1832 | Your bazonium? All I can say is, you look after your bazonium. Don't take it for granted like so many young people these days. I neglected my bazonium and next thing you know, war wound, not wearing my bazonium protector, and WHOP! , uncle Arthusia comes to call, makes my life a misery and a living hell.
627 | 1845 | 1844 | You're joking. Aren't'cha? Say you're joking. What'd they teach you? I mean, what do you think you land on when you go over after a skinful with the lads on the first night's leave you've had since the outbreak of war? 'S right. Your blebs. Blimey.
628 | 1817 | 1816 | Blibber? Just down from the allenoids and left a bit. You want to hope nothink goes wrong with your blibber is all I can say.
629 | 1815 | 1814 | Borms? Your borms is your vitals. Lose your borms, you've had it. Might as well try and do without your blibber.
630 | 1825 | 1824 | Class of its own, the caprifornium. You just count yourself lucky you've got a caprifornium in good working order. Might as well try and live a full wossname with Arthusia as a knackered caprifornium. Life. A full life.
631 | 1849 | 1848 | Doings? Werl, it's a wossname, innit. A wossname.
632 | 1839 | 1838 | Don't want to talk about galleria, really. Not the thing. Just say it's one of those. . . conditions as what military individuals, being as how they are away from home much of the time and has to take their fun where they can find it, is prone to.
633 | 1841 | 1840 | Not much to say, Sir Madam or Thing. Mystery, really. Medical science is baffled. "Gernophilis, " they say, looking grave. "You what?" you say. "Gernophilis, " they say, not looking you in the eye. All I can say is, I hope you never get it. Five minutes of self-indulgence and your life's in tatters, Sir, madam or thing; shreds and tatters. Like your wabs.
634 | 1829 | 1828 | Ah. Nasty side-effect of arthusia, your samorrhoids. Not something you'd want to talk about in company. Like galleria.
635 | 1827 | 1826 | Werl. . . your splanck. . . your splanck. . . werl, it's fed by your allenoids, isn't it? Your allenoids, they feed your splanck with blibber fluids. Lose your splanck, you might as well have lost your blibber. Next stop, Asgon's tregeriasis.
636 | 1813 | 1812 | Tharpoid? Well, you won't get far without your tharpoid. It's up there with the borms, your tharpoid is.
637 | 1837 | 1836 | Treems? You don't know about treems? Blimey, what do you do at weekends? Cor, I know your sort, can't find your own bleb with both hands and a flashlight.
638 | 1843 | 1842 | Blimey, Sir madam or thing; easy to see you've never been unfortunate enough to suffer from gernophilis or you wouldn't even be able to bring yourself to UTTER the word "wabs". They'd be in tatters. Shreds and tatters.
639 | 1847 | 1846 | Wossname? Werl, it's a doings, innit. A doings.
640 | 3 | 2 | Ah, well, funny you should say that, Sir, because in what you might call my fleshly incarnation, before I had the personality donation and blew my brains out, I did in fact only have one arm and one leg. Battle of bin-j'Jabbli, Sir. Fuddy-duddies. Nice chaps, brave soldiers, good show, nasty business, rough deal, bad luck. Bang! Leg. Bang! Arm. Bad luck. Good fun.
641 | 11 | 10 | Old army expression, Sir, when I was serving under General Shatton, or maybe it was Perman, never can recall these things but a fair fight, Sir, and the best side won. Our side.
642 | 19 | 18 | Very good, Sir, and I'll tell you something you might not know, little matter of military history: the Amalon warrior-women used to cut off their own right arm so that it didn't get in the way of their breast-- no, hang on, that's wrong. No. I tell a lie. Left arm.
643 | 27 | 26 | Good day to you, Sir, Madam or Thing, and a great deal better than some of the days we've been having recently. Indeed, my old trouble has quite cleared up so that it will be a pleasure to attend to your vertical transportation requirements.
644 | 35 | 34 | Bit of a bootstrap operation, that, Sir. Bit beyond me, although you might not think so given my occupation now, even though I have been used to better things.
645 | 43 | 42 | Morning, or whatever. Sir! I don't suppose you were ever a military man, military woman, thing no, silly of me, let's keep it simple, I goes up, I goes down, which is it to be?
646 | 51 | 50 | Morning, Sir, I was just thinking about the first time you come into my lift, "Nobby, " I thought at the time, "Here's someone in your lift" because one thing the army does, it trains you to notice things.
647 | 59 | 58 | Hello, Sir. I was just wondering if you was going to step in here, and here you are, which just goes to show.
648 | 67 | 66 | Hello, Sir. Nice day for vertical transportation, although between ourselves I'd rather be trotting up the ha'aqa bin-j'Jabbli in my p'narma hat, heading for the rebel headquarters with a grenade under my q'jinjan.
649 | 75 | 74 | Ready for action, Sir, and happy to take you anywhere in a vertical direction to what you may wish to travel, halways assuming you is duly authorized as I need ardly had.
650 | 83 | 82 | Hello, Sir. Decided to stay put, then? Very wise. Fomenting discord, I call it, printing stuff like that, encouraging discontent, it's a very nice class you're in, sort of NCO class, very nice indeed, and don't let nobody tell you different.
651 | 91 | 90 | Ah well, Sir, you don't let every little injury get you down. There are always people worse off than you.
652 | 99 | 98 | I am honored to be a robot, Sir. Worked my way up. Being a robot aboard the Titanic, Sir, is like being a color sarnt-maj in a good regiment. Respect. Duty. Discipline. Keep your gun clean, your trousers creased and your hands outside the bedclothes, won't go far wrong.
653 | 107 | 106 | I'm tempted to agree with you, Sir, and in my day we'd have had it up on a charge, had the whole ship up on a charge, peeling splods, extras, jankers, call it what you will.
654 | 115 | 114 | That's not the half of it, Sir. There's things aboard this ship that suck like an unweened seal pup, though I says it as shouldn't. SS Titanic? SS Dorothy, more like.
655 | 123 | 122 | Can't remember, Sir.
656 | 131 | 130 | Yes, well, you might say that, and on the other hand you might not. Reminds me of the Battle of the Broyne, where I lost my leg. Doesn't bother me much now, though, Sir. And this isn't getting us anywhere.
657 | 139 | 138 | I was just thinking the same thing, Sir, and it put me in mind of Nipper Dalgetty and the Bogstar campaign, 'cos I hadn't set eyes on Nipper since Bastern Four, you see, and there he was, large as life, twice as ugly. "Blimey, Nipper, " I says, "So we meet again. " "I was just thinking the same thing, Nobby, " says Nipper, "and it put me in mind of old Snorker Figgis, and. . . " well, you get the picture, Sir.
658 | 291 | 290 | A wise choice, Sir. Vertical transportation is what I do best, given the circumstances under which I am supposed to operate. It's not what I am used to, though.
659 | 147 | 146 | Personally I have never felt better in my life, Sir, but then my body never gave me much trouble now I look back on it. Out of sight, out of mind; that's what I say.
660 | 155 | 154 | Orders, Sir. What you need is an upgrade. No ticket, no entry. Got to have orders. Know where you stand, then. As long as you've got you health and you've got your orders, you're all squared away and ready for anything the enemy cares to throw at you.
661 | 163 | 162 | Ah well. Sir. That's a very interesting thought that is. I remember discussing the same idea with Chalky White in a foxhole outside Wimpers. "Chalky, " I says, "You don't exist. " "No more do you, " says Chalky. "Fair enough, " I says. "How's about a himaginary cuppa char, then?
662 | 171 | 170 | Missed the best days of your life, then, Sir. It'd have been something to look back on when you're a disembodied transplant stuck in a series of ruddy lifts in a starship with personality problems. At least you'd have your memories.
663 | 179 | 178 | No, no, Sir, regard it as a courtesy title. As they say, a little courtesy does no harm. No matter how unworthy you may personally feel.
664 | 541 | 540 | Other lift, Sir? It depends how you mean, other. All for one, one for all, whatever goes up comes down, whatever goes down comes up, whatever happens to me happens to him, whatever happens to him happens to me. It's called soldiering, Sir. Four minds but with a single thought. Sometimes not even that many.
665 | 543 | 542 | Other lift, Sir? Just one of us, Sir. Four jobs to do. Life's like that, so I've found.
666 | 545 | 544 | Other lift, Sir? It's as much as a man at my time of life should be expected to do doing one job, but here you see, I've got four. Four bodies, one mind, you see. Well, you know what they say, a pain shared is a pain halved. Well, they're wrong. A pain shared is a pain doubled. Or in my case quadrupled.
667 | 187 | 186 | It was a parrot as was the mascot in the 33rd Rottingdean Foot Horse when there was that trouble with the Old Man, Sir, or it may have been the 24th Rustington Light Heavy Foot Cavalry. Chalky White in the officers' mess waving a saber and three kitchen-maids weeping in the scullery, if you follow my drift.
668 | 211 | 210 | Down? Lovely direction. Takes me back to my army days. Loved down, I did. Anyone said "Volunteers wanted for down, " there I was. Two paces forward, stamp, salute, yes Sir, right away Sir, I'm your man.
669 | 195 | 194 | Up? Oh, excellent. Oh, I'm so glad you said "Up, " Sir. The moment I saw you, I thought, my goodness, this one has "Up" written all over it, and so it was. Spooky, eh?
670 | 227 | 226 | Now, Sir, now, Sir, no need to take that tone with me, I've got a difficult job to do here and I'd just like to be allowed to get on with it in peace and never mind your rudeness. Tried that in my younger day, I'd have had your throat out, I would.
671 | 235 | 234 | Now, Sir, now, Sir, that won't do, and you know it and I know it, and no point you trying to circumvent me, if that's the word, because rules is rules and there was a time when you'd have bin shot, Sir, shot on the spot like a Balnian at Phlegnos except we're not in the army now, Sir, are we?, so just leave it alone. With respect.
672 | 243 | 242 | No, Sir, no; think of what is becoming, Sir. How would it be if everyone did everything for themselves? You'd have no rank, no structure, it would be anarchy, Sir, anarchy, next thing you know there's be no respect, blood flowing in the streets, you name it, I bin there.
673 | 251 | 250 | Ah, well, Sir, going through a bad patch at the time. Nothing left to believe in, nothing to fight for, someone had to keep the old memories alive so I became a personality donor and blew my brains out. Which wasn't hard, given I'd been trained for it. Never looked back since.
674 | 259 | 258 | Shut up? Shut up? Let me tell you. If you'd of said that to me when I was a fighting man. I'd have. I'd have. Fought you. And no mistake.
675 | 363 | 362 | Well, Sir, there's plenty of rooms aboard this ship that fit the bill and many as ought to but don't due to circumstances I don't wish to go into. . . and there's nothing I'd like better than to spend the rest of eternity ferrying you from one to the other, but frankly I don't think you'd last the course.
676 | 379 | 378 | Wouldn't mind seeing the old place myself either, Sir, plenty of fond memories, none of them my own of course but you know how it is when you're what you might call retentive. Whacker got his eye put out there, old Deggsy, he was a funny bloke, mind you, he saw the way the place was going, got himself transplanted just before it went down the lizard. Rhyming slang, Sir, lizard on the hearthrug, plug.
677 | 387 | 386 | Well a nice idea, Sir, nice try, but no can do. Not how life works. Reminds me of the siege of Sidi ben Abed, holed up for eleven weeks, skin and bone, eating rats and Gawd knows what the rats was eating, "I wish it was all over" says Stonker Barrington. "Stonker, " says I, "Nice idea, but not how life works.
678 | 323 | 322 | Gaw, Sir, I can see the luxury is working its old magic, mental processes slowing down, a devil-may-care loucheness creeping over you and who can blame you, I went that way after three months posted to Berrocca, you just stop bothering about things like specifying which floor you want.
679 | 395 | 394 | Home, Sir? Where's home? What I say is, as long as you've got your health, home is wherever you hang your hat, if you have a hat, which is why you'll never see a soldier without one. Not home, hat. Otherwise how would he know where he was home, without a hat to hang? See? Once you know the facts, it all makes sense.
680 | 331 | 330 | Very much in favor of that class, Sir. In fact, call me old fashioned, I think it's one of the nicer classes on the ship, and well supplied with floors which brings me to the point, Sir, which is: could you be a little more specific in your orders because heaven help you if you was a officer, Sir, being that vague.
681 | 371 | 370 | Of course in the old days, Sir, that would have been First Class but everything's got more luxurious now. Perfumed soap. Breeding a generation of softies if you ask me, but nobody ever does.
682 | 299 | 298 | On the move, Sir? That's right. Time spent in reconnaissance is never wasted, as that chap General wotsisname, you know, the Sprod bloke, used to say. He's dead, now, Sir. Ambushed. Walked into a trap, hacked to pieces.
683 | 339 | 338 | Yes, Sir, all much of a muchness, that class, but then when you've been under canvas as much as I have you get used to much of a muchness. I mean it's up to you, Sir, take your chances with the random malignity of fate, or give me a specific floor.
684 | 219 | 218 | Down, Sir? Certainly, Sir. Excellent direction, down, and of course you've got gravity on your side, even here. Mostly. Takes me back to Phlegnos, Sir, abseiling down them cliffs with wossname potting at us, them Balneans, and of course you'd have been stuck without gravity, abseiling.
685 | 315 | 314 | Can't take you to first no more than poor old Whacker Wilmshurst could dance on the table in the NCOs' Mess. Rules is rules, I always say. Rules is rules. Rules is rules. Rules is rules. Rules is Rules. See, I always say that.
686 | 307 | 306 | Lovely class, Sir, although it could be better if things were a little more shall we say organized, never mind the ruddy parrot, takes me back to the old 33rd Anaconda Foot Horse, the parrot does.
687 | 267 | 266 | Yes Sir, Right away Sir. If I may say so, Sir, I always though you was destined for top rank travel, Sir. A look in the eye. Officer class, I call it, though I've seen a few officers cock up in my day, no time for them, Sir, no time at all.
688 | 275 | 274 | Very nice rooms, Sir, if you don't fancy going the full whack, and who's to say what you'd find if you did, given the state things is in.
689 | 283 | 282 | Nice little rooms, Sir. When everything works. If everything works. Quart into a pint pot, Sir, if you remember quarts and pints. Probably before your time, but it was that sort of thing as won the war.
690 | 355 | 354 | Sorry, Sir. Can't no more take you there than I could take a nest of rebel machine-gunners armed with a bag of rotten tomatoes and both legs through one hole in me underpants.
691 | 347 | 346 | Assuming the top is still there, Sir, which is the sort of assumption it would be dangerous to make under the current circumstances.
692 | 203 | 202 | Up. . . Up. . . takes me back, up does. Blimey, if memory serves, or was it, knife between the teeth, surge of adrenaline, officers gone barmy, no organization, everything snafu and shot to hell. . . bit like this business, eh, Sir?
693 | 405 | 404 | Piece of cake, Sir. Drop in to the donor center, they suck your personality out, copy it, squirt it back again and Bob's your uncle.
694 | 413 | 412 | Nonsense. Sir. Never felt better. Except perhaps at bin-j'Jabbli. Fine battle. Borms ripped out by an Hadjadji scimitar. Guts everywhere. Mine. Not complaining. Fair fight. Enjoyed it. Healed up.
695 | 421 | 420 | Couldn't agree more, Sir. Far too many old fools banging on about the war. Wounds, battles, who cares? Never think about it myself. War? What war, that's what I say.
696 | 429 | 428 | Sort of elephantiasis, Sir, not something I worry about given my constitution but I remember old Jumbo Trotter coming down with it in the Hoolu campaign, swole up like a poisoned dog he did, Sir, wossnames and all, and after that he was known as Doggy.
697 | 437 | 436 | Bit of a problem with the old brainbox, Sir, the noddle, the old Queen. Queen Bractaria, rhyming slang, Sir, Queen Bractaria is dead, head, something to do with pressure as it might be; highly competitive individuals suddenly can't take more and old Brain goes.
698 | 445 | 444 | You know, Sir, must of come across the phrase in your military days, the C. O. , Sir, like the captain of this here starship although if you ask me we haven't got a captain, they say it's a self-captaining vessel but I don't see much sign of that.
699 | 453 | 452 | Heart problem, Sir. Unexpected heartbeats. Won't kill you, though that's what they said about my old corporal, Chalky White, and it was a heart problem got him in the end. Although his heart problem wasn't so much unexpected heartbeats as an unexpected assegai through the chest.
700 | 461 | 460 | War? I don't think we should talk about the war in this beautiful vessel designed for peaceful, recreational purposes. Perhaps we should discuss your vertical transportation requirements instead.
701 | 469 | 468 | Old military expression, Sir, dating back to the War of the Symbagargian Moons. The C. O. , nice chap called Major Akrophorbis, three legs and green as your hat, but one of Nature's gentlemen, he took a boson stream in his middle eye, keels over, looks up at me out of his good eyes, "Nobby, " he said, "I'm done for. This is it. Bob's your uncle. " There you are, Sir.
702 | 485 | 484 | Learnt that in the Army, Sir. Always someone worse off and often it's a surprise. Take the Architect of this here ship. Famous, successful, rich. . . you'd think he'd not have a care in the world, Sir, wouldn't you? Of course you would. And you'd be wrong.
703 | 493 | 492 | Ah well that's a good question Sir and it puts me in mind of of old Sapper Bancroft in the old Wimpers campaign, surrounded by hostiles we was but we come up with this intricate plan. Intricate. Sapper's against it but he's overruled. Off we go. Works a treat. "That's fine in practice, " says Sapper, "but I still don't reckon it'll work in theory.
704 | 477 | 476 | Ship's only just been launched, Sir. Bedding-in. Teething troubles. Time flies. It's mostly the waiting, Sir, sends you Doolally, i. e. , round the twist, Sir. Named after Dulali transit camp in Penanda, Sir, men would go mad. The heat. The flies. None of that here, Sir, thank Heavens. Not as yet.
705 | 501 | 500 | I wouldn't worry if I were you, Sir. Bad idea, worry. That's where Monty went wrong. Fine soldier, but a worrier.
706 | 1 | 0 | Very funny, Sir. Laughter's the best medicine.
707 | 9 | 8 | Metaphor, Sir. Something to do with worms.
708 | 17 | 16 | Not quite, Sir. You stand, I deliver. Just my little joke.
709 | 25 | 24 | Good day to you, Sir, Madam or Thing. And how may we assist you in your vertical transportation requirements today?
710 | 33 | 32 | The problem doesn't lie with the lift, Sir.
711 | 41 | 40 | Sniff.
712 | 49 | 48 | Hello, Sir, lovely day for going up and down.
713 | 57 | 56 | Oh, it's you, is it? Fair enough.
714 | 65 | 64 | Here you are again, Sir. Can't keep away, then.
715 | 73 | 72 | All present and correct, Sir!
716 | 81 | 80 | Hello, Sir. Decided to pass up that old upgrade routine, then?
717 | 89 | 88 | Nothing to it, Sir. Honestly don't know what the fuss is about.
718 | 97 | 96 | Indeed. Sir. And proud of it.
719 | 105 | 104 | Not the only thing, Sir.
720 | 113 | 112 | So does a Hoover, Sir, and nobody complains about that.
721 | 121 | 120 | Doesn't matter, Sir.
722 | 129 | 128 | Ah, well, that's as may be. Sir.
723 | 137 | 136 | A very penetrating observation, Sir.
724 | 289 | 288 | Room, Sir? Certainly, Sir.
725 | 145 | 144 | Who said I was ill, Sir? Never felt better.
726 | 153 | 152 | Wrong class, Sir. Not it; you.
727 | 161 | 160 | Quite right. Sir. And you're just a figment of my himagination.
728 | 169 | 168 | Blimey. What did you do with yourself, then? Don't tell me.
729 | 177 | 176 | That's all right, Sir. It's no trouble.
730 | 539 | 538 | Other lift, Sir? It's all the same to us, Sir. We're all as one. Comrades in identity you might say.
731 | 185 | 184 | Nothing but trouble, parrots, Sir.
732 | 209 | 208 | Down? Certainly. Much nicer than up, down. That's what I always say.
733 | 193 | 192 | Up? Certainly, Sir. Nothing could be more. . . uppish. Quite my favorite direction.
734 | 225 | 224 | Sticks and stones, Sir; sticks and stones.
735 | 233 | 232 | No, no Sir. No can do. Rules.
736 | 241 | 240 | Now now. Naughty Sir. Allow me.
737 | 249 | 248 | Right thing to do Sir. And feel all the better for it.
738 | 257 | 256 | Shut up? No sooner said than-
739 | 361 | 360 | I fear you will have to be more specific, Sir.
740 | 377 | 376 | I'm afraid that is beyond the capability of a humble vertical transportation technologist, Sir.
741 | 385 | 384 | Afraid that's somewhere you'll have to take yourself, Sir.
742 | 321 | 320 | Afraid we're not in Berrocca now, Sir. You'll have to give me a precise floor.
743 | 393 | 392 | But Sir, Starlight Lines would like you to look upon this as your home.
744 | 329 | 328 | Perfectly nice class, that, Sir. But, er, which particular floor of it did you require?
745 | 369 | 368 | Nice class, that, Sir. One of my favorites.
746 | 297 | 296 | Getting cabin fever, Sir? They are a bit. . . small.
747 | 337 | 336 | Any particular part, Sir, or did you just fancy slumming it at random?
748 | 217 | 216 | Down, Sir? Or just. . . down-ish?
749 | 313 | 312 | Sorry, Sir. Can't be done.
750 | 305 | 304 | Very nice class, Sir. Very becoming.
751 | 265 | 264 | Yes Sir. Right away Sir. Pleasure to transport a gent like yourself, Sir.
752 | 273 | 272 | Lovely room, Sir. Quite a step up.
753 | 281 | 280 | Nice little rooms, Sir. When everything works.
754 | 353 | 352 | Wouldn't mind going there myself, Sir, but it's out of the question at the moment.
755 | 345 | 344 | Top of what would that be, Sir?
756 | 201 | 200 | Up, Sir? Certainly, Sir. Fingers crossed, Sir.
757 | 403 | 402 | Nothing to it, Sir. Bit of a buzzing and Bob's your Uncle.
758 | 411 | 410 | Nonsense. Sir. Fighting fit.
759 | 419 | 418 | Quite right. Best forgotten. Never think about it myself.
760 | 427 | 426 | Agony, Sir, swell up like a blowfish, can't move, never bothered me much.
761 | 547 | 546 | More than my job's worth to talk about, Sir.
762 | 549 | 548 | It's not what I'd normally mention, Sir, because I'm not one to tell tales out of school, but this geezer, one of the big white chiefs gets in the lift and without so much as a by your leave rips my head off. Well one of them. Not this one of course. You can probably tell that it wasn't this one.
763 | 567 | 566 | And what floor would that be on, Sir, to the best of your memory?
764 | 569 | 568 | Can't help you, Sir. More than my job's worth.
765 | 551 | 550 | Pain and humiliation, Sir. The normal thing one comes to expect. Doesn't do to talk about it though.
766 | 553 | 552 | Getting your head ripped off, Sir, and thrown down a well, it's what you get used to in my line of work. Or what was my line of work. Did I mention I was a soldier, Sir? I think I did. At least in those days when you got your head ripped off it was usually not by one of your own officers. Went against the code of conduct, Sir. Not the same on civvy street, you'll find. Mere employers will think nothing of ripping your head off if they've got a mind to. No sense of what's right, Sir, no sense of what's right.
767 | 555 | 554 | More than my job's worth, Sir.
768 | 557 | 556 | More than my job's worth, Sir. Much more than my job's worth. A very, very great deal more than my job is worth.
769 | 559 | 558 | More than my job's worth, Sir.
770 | 561 | 560 | More than my job's worth, Sir. Not that that's very hard seeing as how very little my job is worth, Sir, even though it is all I have to show for a life of service for my country, Sir, precious little thanks it is, but I can't afford to lose it, Sir, by talking out of turn.
771 | 563 | 562 | I don't know what you're talking about Sir, I really don't.
772 | 565 | 564 | I've been trying to follow your drift, Sir, but I just can't catch it. Funny. I usually catch everything that's going, me.
773 | 435 | 434 | Sort of rupture of the old brain, Sir. Nothing to worry about.
774 | 443 | 442 | The old man, Sir. It's an expression.
775 | 451 | 450 | Heart problem, Sir. Nothing to worry about.
776 | 459 | 458 | What war? No, no, you mean: what floor.
777 | 467 | 466 | Someone's Uncle, Sir.
778 | 483 | 482 | Always someone, Sir. Take yourself.
779 | 491 | 490 | Well I'm not sure that it is. But that's the theory.
780 | 475 | 474 | Goes by in a flash, Sir.
781 | 499 | 498 | Me, Sir? No reason at all, Sir.
782 | 7 | 6 | Well, Sir, they say laughter's the best medicine but it's not done much for me, I must say. Never been much of a one for laughter, silly business, makes your lungs hurt, bad for you in the long run.
783 | 15 | 14 | Ah, well, that's a medical term for 'leg gone black'. I picked up from the old field medic at the Battle of Santraginea, went in, leg's gone black, Sir. Looks at me. Bless my soul, Nobby, he says, that's a whole new can of ballpark. He was an Benarican, Sir. Died, I believe. Nasty. Well, would have been. Killed him. Don't come nastier than that, Sir.
784 | 23 | 22 | Oh, no, Sir, I don't think so. All that standing around and the noise and the people, sneezing all over you, you could come down with something, not to mention the repetitive strain injury, no, one-armed bandit? Ooh no, wouldn't suit me at all.
785 | 31 | 30 | Good day. If you can call it a good day. Day, night, it's all the same. As for good? Ha. I should laugh. Unremitting pain and nothing to look forward to but dishonor and the grave.
786 | 39 | 38 | If I could fix the lift, Sir, don't you think I might start by fixing myself, given my transtentorial herniation, not to mention Asgon's Tregeriasis and my duff leg. Good thing I don't have logamnesia to boot.
787 | 47 | 46 | Hello hello, well, didn't think we'd be seeing nobody here, not after what's been goin' on, didn't think I'd be spared to see it, neither, but here you are and there it is and we'd better get on with it.
788 | 55 | 54 | Oh, well, no rest for the wicked, where to this time, assuming my Tregeriasis holds out?
789 | 63 | 62 | Hello, Sir. . . I don't know where you want to go, not having the gift of third sight, but I have to tell you my arthusia's pretty bad today, so up will be a bit of a problem, and so will down. Just so as you understand.
790 | 71 | 70 | I was just thinking about you, Sir. Thought you might like to know my blibber's on the turn again, has been since our last encounter. I think it must be the stress, on account of the system being. . . on account of the system.
791 | 79 | 78 | Do you know what it is, Sir? I've been thinking, it's the system and the feedback and the hatmosphere, Sir, that's what it is, that and the gravitationals, that's what it is, but I'll do my best, I can't say fairer than that.
792 | 87 | 86 | I been thinking, Sir, there's been nothing else to do, but you're very wise, contenting yourself with your position, life is short and all this striving to get on, move up in the world, where does it get you? Ebernitis, that's where. Ebernitis and borms and Asgon's Tregeriasis and your blibber on the blink and your wabs gorn, oh, and it's just not worth it. I'd have said as much to my old missus if I'd had a missus.
793 | 95 | 94 | Ah, well, that's a whole new can of ball park, as you might say, and if I was to start there'd be no telling where I might finish.
794 | 103 | 102 | Indeed, Sir. And, oh, the irony of my situation. All my memories intact. Every gunshot wound, every laser burn, every battleaxe-chop and sword-slash and what are those big things that chuck stones called? Got one of them in the face on Betelgeuse I think it was.
795 | 111 | 110 | Tragic, isn't it, Sir? And somehow it matches my mood, a sort of combination of preventricular excitation and, well, ileitis if you want me to put a name to it, although it's all theoretical now.
796 | 119 | 118 | If you say so, Sir, though I can't say I notice it myself, being used to a lot worse, what with my wounds and my illnesses and one thing and another and another on top of that, though I don't wish to burden you with my complaints.
797 | 127 | 126 | Logamnesia, Sir? I don't recall. Perhaps it's the inability to remember words. Yes. That's it. Must have slipped my mind, Sir.
798 | 135 | 134 | Well no, there was a time - was a time - when that would have been significant but that was before my tharpoid deficiency. Gives me gyp, that does. Not to mention the personality transplant.
799 | 537 | 536 | Yes, well, you might say that, Sir. Doesn't make much difference when you're out in the field, not to my way of thinking. I remember at the Battle of the Broyne - dead of night, foray into no-man's land, old Shorty took a nasty one and said "I think I've took a nasty one, Sir". If I'd said "Don't call me Sir, I'm a Madam, " I don't where it would have got me. Nowhere I'd want to be, I know that.
800 | 143 | 142 | I was just thinking the same thing, Sir, and wondering if it was me memory that was at fault or if you were in and out of this shaft like a piston. I wouldn't worry that I'm trying to get some rest, Sir, it's been a long life, and I'm an old soldier but I wouldn't be here now if I didn't know when to put duty above my personal comfort and well being.
801 | 295 | 294 | Well. . . we'll do it, Sir, God willing, and I'm not one to make a fuss -- ask anyone, is Nobby one to make a fuss? Any of the lads would say, no, Nobby? Fuss? Gertcha. Not on. Stoical type, Nobby, even when he's in agony. Which I am, Sir.
802 | 151 | 150 | Far be it from me to contradict you, Sir, but the fact is that an actual body is merely a distraction when it comes to feeling lousy. All in the mind, Sir; all in the mind.
803 | 159 | 158 | It's just one of things, Sir. Like genes. You've got the wrong ticket and you can't get up to the class you want. I've got the wrong genes and I'm a walking pathology specimen. The difference is, you can get an upgrade. All I can hope for is the silence of the tomb, and I've blown that one good and proper.
804 | 167 | 166 | Would you were right, Sir. Oblivion would come as a relief. To one in my condition. Chest, Sir. Over-exertion when young. Grancher's disease, they calls it. Thought it would go when I had my transplant but no such luck.
805 | 175 | 174 | Very wise, Sir. It was the Army as finally did for my health, I used to be fit and strong though you wouldn't think it to look at me, now I'm nothing more than a glorified light-bulb with an arm, but Army life. . . well, one campaign after another, shot, stabbed, speared, irradiated. . . I could handle that. It's the bad grub, Sir. The bad grub and sleeping rough.
806 | 183 | 182 | Sorry, Sir, but if I was to spend my time thinking up appropriate salutations for everyone as was likely to step into this here elevator, I wouldn't have time to attend to my personal vertical transportation duties and my health would deteriorate even more than it has.
807 | 191 | 190 | Well, Sir, the Old Man wasn't best pleased when he saw it, from what I heard, and who can blame him. They're carriers, Sir. Parrot Fever. Very insanitary birds, Sir, strangers to the meaning of ship-shape.
808 | 215 | 214 | Down? It's all right for some. Fit as a fiddle, happy as a lark. "Down, " you says, blithely. And never a thought for them as has to do it. As it might be in agony. Terrible stabbing pain all sort of radiating out of my old war wound. Never mind. Down it is.
809 | 199 | 198 | Up? I don't suppose you could make it "down" could you? No, I didn't think so, too much to ask, you young people today, you've had it soft all your lives, not a clue what it means to die for a cause you believed in, oh no. It's just up, up, up as far you're concerned.
810 | 231 | 230 | Yes, well, you speak your mind Sir, I'm sure it makes you feel better and when I'm found dead in agony I expect you won't have a moment's disquiet that you was offensive to a harmless old soldier trying to do his best in the face of truly appalling health problems.
811 | 239 | 238 | Can't go there, Sir, sorry to say. If you was entitled, I'd be only too happy to help, at whatever cost to my health, but you're not entitled, that's how it is and there you have it.
812 | 247 | 246 | No, Sir. I must insist, at whatever cost to my health, that you allow me to take care of your vertical transportation requirements and never mind that my allenoids is giving me gyp, stiff upper doings is my watchword, you're never so rickety you can't pull your own wossname.
813 | 255 | 254 | Well, why not, Sir, is how I look at it, what with the wounds and the aches and pains, the frozen shoulder and the Asgon's Tregeriasis, Bell's Palsy, constant splitting pain in the caprifornium, plus my splanck had gone, I had chronic ebernitis and shrapnel in me ear. Now do you see the point, Sir?
814 | 263 | 262 | Shut up? Shut up? Very sorry, Sir. Against the rules. Nothing I'd like better. Larynx. Shrapnel. Torn to ribbons. Bits hanging off. Blood. Slime. Surgeon shocked. Threw up. Orrible. War? What do you know about war? Pipsqueak.
815 | 367 | 366 | Normally nothing would give me more pleasure, Sir, but unfortunately I have a touch of agoraphobia at the moment. Still, I'll do my best and you can't say fairer than that.
816 | 383 | 382 | Well that's all very well, Sir, but even if I could, which I can't, I wouldn't, so I won't. I mean what if we landed in an area of drug-resistant galleria? No joke, galleria, had it myself, shakes, sweats, hallucinations, wouldn't wish it on a dog.
817 | 391 | 390 | You don't want to do that, Sir. Keep on striving, Sir. Striving and struggling, that's what I say, even though your lungs has gorn and you heart's gorn, your tharpoid's gorn and your treem's gorn, your pancreas and anphosterous system, your nerves and your borms and your muscles and your allenoids. . . keep going, even though you're in agony, Sir. That's what I do.
818 | 327 | 326 | You ever had your wabs go on you, Sir? Your wabs and your gorms? Probably not, a distinguished Sir like yourself, but it's no joke, and one of the things is, when your wabs is gorn and your gorms is gorn, you need a bit of a helping hand when it comes to things like vertical transportation. You need to be told which floor you're going to.
819 | 399 | 398 | Home? What, you mean like a nursing home? Like a convalescent home with all them poor old geezers coughing their lungs out in the sunshine, kidding themselves they'll be out soon but the truth is the only way they're leaving is in a wooden box, feet first. Home? No; can't do that, Sir.
820 | 335 | 334 | I'm sorry, Sir, terrible pains in the caprifornium and I wouldn't be surprised if I came down with a touch of gernophilis, but I'm doing my best, sort of clinging on, really, until such time as you tell me the precise floor you're after.
821 | 375 | 374 | Well yes, Sir, if you insist, but you ought to know that it's not doing me any good in my condition, up and down like a yo-yo which is what you expect in a lift but I never had any say in the matter, oh no, one day I'm reasonably cheery, plodding along in an Ultra Toast-O-Mat, next moment here I am. It's a step, I told myself, but of course it was nothing of the sort.
822 | 303 | 302 | I'd recommend going back to your room and just lying low, Sir. Very dangerous, wandering around, given that the climate control in this here ship has not been all it should be of late. You could get a cold, turns to arthusia, Samorrhoids, borm collapses, bazonia, Asgon's Tregeriasis, dead as a hogo before you know it. But don't let me put you off.
823 | 343 | 342 | Look, Sir, let me be blunt. I've got this terrible spodiatritis, my tharpoid's just like a white-hot flame eating away at my blibber, I can hardly think straight, I am very anxious to help you but please, Sir, meet me half way: Which floor do you want?
824 | 223 | 222 | Well. . . fair enough, if you don't mind the sinking feeling, always presuming you get the sinking feeling, I get the sinking feeling something horrible, haven't been the same since Wimpers although between you and me I wasn't the same before Wimpers either.
825 | 319 | 318 | Well, Sir, there's many of us what is in constant agony with fasciolopsiasis picked up in the service of our country, what wouldn't say no to a nice lie-down in one of them luxury cabins. But some of us isn't allowed in First Class, and neither are you, Sir.
826 | 311 | 310 | Very nice too, Sir, first class, and there's plenty of us would give our eye teeth for a nice lie-down on one of them beds, if we still had our eye teeth, which some of us don't on account of having blown them out with a revolver-shell.
827 | 271 | 270 | And I am sure you will enjoy it, Sir, although I have to say a room like that would turn to ashes in my mouth, if I had a mouth, that being where as a matter of fact I shot myself. Military tradition, Sir. Hurts like hell, no matter what they tell you.
828 | 279 | 278 | I suppose you'll be having a potter about, a bit of a sit down, a bit of a snooze? All right for some but I haven't had a potter since the battle of bin-j'Jabbli, let alone a sit down, and as for a snooze, well, I wouldn't recognize a snooze if it bit me.
829 | 287 | 286 | Room? Hutch, I'd call it, and a dangerous hutch at that. You could do yourself an injury. Nasty things, injuries. Probably why they call them injuries.
830 | 359 | 358 | Why? Even if you were authorized, what would be the point? What would it be for? Would you be happier? No. What ails you, Sir, is the human condition. There is no cure. Sorry. Bit low. Shell-shock, Sir. Post-traumatic wossname. Sorry.
831 | 351 | 350 | Nasty word to use to an old soldier, Sir. "Top. " You know. "Over the top. " Makes me all sort of. . . knot up, just where my hernia used to be.
832 | 207 | 206 | Yes, well, you can say "Up" blithely but it's not that straightforward, for one thing you're fighting against gravity, not to mention the danger of altitude hypoxia although, being in deep space, we're pressurized but that could fail.
833 | 409 | 408 | Bad mistake Sir. Thought: personality transplant, take up residence in a nice comfy electronic system somewhere, go home, blow brains out. Memories safe, honor preserved in a manner of speaking, no more aches, pains, war-wounds. Wrong. Pain in the leg? No. Leg's in the leg. Pain's in the memory. Still got it. Phantom leg. Phantom everything. Mug's game. Dog's life.
834 | 417 | 416 | No, well, that'll probably be on account of the liver, Sir. Old soldier. Blibber full of parasites. Flukes. Worms. Bugs. Crawling things. Size of a plum. Greenish. Hard. Covered in nodules. Defend your country and look what you get. Unwell? Ho ho ho.
835 | 425 | 424 | Easy for you to say. But have you ever had to run up a two thousand foot hill in full battledress with a fool for a C. O. and the enemy raining a hail of lead down on you like a. . . like a. . . like a hail. Of lead. Course not, else you'd have one arm and a stiff neck like the rest of us.
836 | 433 | 432 | Trouble with the old anphosterous system, Sir, bugs, bad business, you have to push yourself around in a wheelbarrow if you follow my meaning.
837 | 441 | 440 | Tragic business, Sir, tragic, like a hernia inside your own actual personal head, well, not yours necessarily but the unfortunate sufferer, as it might be - in this case my good self, but that's par for the course at the moment, if you ask me the whole ship's not right in the head.
838 | 449 | 448 | The Old Man, Sir, a term of respect for the C. O. but in rather bad taste, old age being no joke whatsoever in my book though you wouldn't know about that, you've probably had a foretaste, the odd twinge. "Be back to my old self tomorrow, " you think, but you're wrong you know - you never will. Your old self's gone Sir, gone forever. Gone.
839 | 457 | 456 | Ah well now, disease is a funny thing, probably a combination of bad diet, going all over the world, not to mention the galaxy, trying to do my duty and where does it get you? A lift, is where.
840 | 465 | 464 | What war? What war? Blimey. . . only the war, that's all. The one as left me the pitiful wreck you see before you. Yes, I was a fighting man once, though you wouldn't think of it to look at me now.
841 | 473 | 472 | Oddly enough, Sir, I had an uncle Bob. Nice chap; helium miner on Betelgeuse 2/28B which was the beginning of his downfall. Used to suck helium at parties, do the squeaky voice, thought he could take it or leave it alone but next thing you knew: hooked. Talked like a chipmunk, got the horrors every time he tried to kick it, in the end he took an overdose, floated up to the ceiling and died of starvation. Horrible way to go.
842 | 489 | 488 | Well. . . take someone in rude health, Sir, rude good health. In a way, Sir, they're much worse off than me. There they go, not a care in the world, everything fine, and all the time Fate, Sir, is waiting round the corner with a sockful of wet sand. Samorrhoids, as it might be, Sir, or Asgon's Tregeriasis, or their insides, or even going round the twist. It's the waiting, Sir. That's the torture.
843 | 497 | 496 | I mean theoretical seeing as how I am what you might call "disembodied" although "re-embodied" might be more precise, but the point is, Sir, you've heard of a phantom leg? Well what you've got here is a kind of phantom Nobby.
844 | 481 | 480 | Time hangs heavy when you're bored rigid and wracked with pain, Sir. A moment can seem an eternity when every allenoid is a capsule of white-hot agony on account of certain conditions contracted in the service of your country.
845 | 505 | 504 | Nothing, Sir. No reason at all. Just because I'm riddled with tropical diseases, phantom limbs, phantom body come to that, bullet-holes and shrapnel and a splitting headache where I blew my brains out, is no reason for anyone else to worry.
846 | 5 | 4 | Oh very funny Sir. I'd split my sides if they weren't already split.
847 | 13 | 12 | Means something new, Sir. Like a new pain where you didn't have one before.
848 | 21 | 20 | Very nice, Sir. Makes me feel a lot better, that does.
849 | 29 | 28 | Good day. Oooooh ooh!
850 | 37 | 36 | Better idea to put us all out of our misery, Sir.
851 | 45 | 44 | I suppose I should say welcome but my Samorrhoids are giving me hell.
852 | 53 | 52 | Groan.
853 | 61 | 60 | Oh dear, Sir. This means more arm-action, I'll be bound.
854 | 69 | 68 | Oh dear, Sir. Some sort of floor you wanted, was it?
855 | 77 | 76 | If you could just hang on a moment, Sir, while I try to summon my strength. . .
856 | 85 | 84 | Oh well, Sir. You and me both. Stuck with our respective positions in life.
857 | 93 | 92 | A mass of them, I am, Sir. Almost 100 per cent injury, I was, till my transplant.
858 | 101 | 100 | And even that not for long, I shouldn't think, Sir.
859 | 109 | 108 | Well, Sir, I know how it feels.
860 | 117 | 116 | Wish I could, Sir. But it's my allenoids, you see. Gorn.
861 | 125 | 124 | Never heard of it, Sir.
862 | 133 | 132 | I'm afraid it's all one to me these days, Sir.
863 | 141 | 140 | I'd enjoy the encounter more, Sir, if it weren't for my spleen.
864 | 293 | 292 | I think I might just make that, Sir.
865 | 149 | 148 | Don't you believe it, Sir.
866 | 157 | 156 | We all have our cross to bear, Sir. With me it's my health. With you, it's your class.
867 | 165 | 164 | Would you were right, Sir. Would you were right.
868 | 173 | 172 | All I can say then, Sir, is you don't know what pain is.
869 | 181 | 180 | Best I can do, Sir, the way I feel today.
870 | 189 | 188 | Menace, Sir. Psittacosis.
871 | 213 | 212 | You should be so lucky.
872 | 197 | 196 | Up? Oh perfect. Marvelous. Up. Just what I need, in my condition.
873 | 229 | 228 | Suffering has inured me to your childish abuse, Sir.
874 | 237 | 236 | No no no no no. No. No no no. Oh, my borms and blibber, no.
875 | 245 | 244 | Sir, Sir, Sir. Would you deny me the only pleasure I have in life?
876 | 253 | 252 | I'd today it again today, Sir, except I doubt I could get a gun to my head, what with the aphoritis .
877 | 261 | 260 | Frankly it would be a relief. Sir. Shrapnel. Larynx. Don't like to talk about it.
878 | 365 | 364 | Sorry, Sir, you'll have to be more specific. Touch of spatial dysphasia. Probably the weather.
879 | 381 | 380 | I would, Sir, but I'm afraid my stomach isn't up to it.
880 | 389 | 388 | The end will come soon enough, Sir. Personally, I'll welcome it.
881 | 325 | 324 | Oh. Ohhhh. Put me out of me misery, Sir. Tell me which floor.
882 | 397 | 396 | Home? Home? All right for some, Sir, but no can do.
883 | 333 | 332 | Oh dear. Oh dear. Do tell me which floor, precisely, Sir, or my ebernitis will flare up again.
884 | 373 | 372 | Providing I can get my wrist moving, it'll be my pleasure, Sir.
885 | 301 | 300 | Well, Sir, let's just see if I can get the lever to move, shall we?
886 | 341 | 340 | I might be able to manage it, Sir, if only you could be a little more specific.
887 | 221 | 220 | Down, Sir? Just a bit. The old trouble, playing me up. . . oh, down. Sorry, Sir. Miles away.
888 | 317 | 316 | Sorry Sir. Not allowed to take you and doubt if I could even if I was.
889 | 309 | 308 | With my joints, Sir? I'll do my best.
890 | 269 | 268 | I hope you enjoy it, Sir, though what does luxury matter if you don't have your health?
891 | 277 | 276 | Pleasure, Sir, in so much as anything can be a pleasure in my condition.
892 | 285 | 284 | Really? I suppose you know best, Sir.
893 | 357 | 356 | Can't be done, Sir.
894 | 349 | 348 | If you insist, Sir. I'll try to control my vertigo.
895 | 205 | 204 | Up? You don't find the stomach sort of drops, going up, Sir? No? Fair enough.
896 | 407 | 406 | Worst mistake of my life, Sir. Thought it would be a change, but it's just the same old thing.
897 | 415 | 414 | Don't sound well? Don't sound well? I should ruddy cocoa.
898 | 423 | 422 | It's all right for some as haven't got shrapnel pains right up their elbow.
899 | 431 | 430 | Can't hardly bring myself to speak of it, Sir.
900 | 439 | 438 | Just thinking about it makes my head ache Sir.
901 | 447 | 446 | The Old Man, Sir. Old and grey and wracked with aches and pains.
902 | 455 | 454 | Heart problem, Sir. Don't want to talk about it or I'll get upset. Bad for me heart.
903 | 463 | 462 | What war? What war? Blimey. . . only the war, that's all.
904 | 471 | 470 | Someone's Uncle, Sir. Probably dead by now. Lucky beggar: better out than in, I say.
905 | 487 | 486 | I know, Sir. Hard to imagine, isn't it?
906 | 495 | 494 | Just is. Still hurts, though you don't find me complaining.
907 | 479 | 478 | Seems like an eternity, Sir, when you're suffering.
908 | 503 | 502 | I wouldn't expect you to, Sir.
909 | 507 | 506 | Nobody likes a smartass, Sir.
910 | 509 | 508 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we, Sir?
911 | 511 | 510 | Very droll, very droll, Sir. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though, shall we?
912 | 513 | 512 | Very clever, very clever, Sir. But in the end - unimpressive.
913 | 515 | 514 | Fascinating. Astonishing, Sir. And yet meaningless.
914 | 517 | 516 | Do you know, I don't know what you're talking about, Sir. That's the official line, and I'm sticking to it.
915 | 519 | 518 | I know exactly what you mean, Sir. But let's not dwell on the past, eh?
916 | 521 | 520 | Interesting reference, Sir. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
917 | 523 | 522 | You're testing me aren't you?
918 | 527 | 526 | Good, because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness. . .
919 | 525 | 524 | Well, I passed. Shall we get on with our lives now, Sir?
920 | 401 | 400 | Rules is rules. Rules is rules.
921 | 529 | 528 | Bombs? Don't talk to me about bombs. I could tell you stories about bombs that'd have yer giblets coming out yer ears.
922 | 531 | 530 | Not a word I like to hear used in vain - bomb. Gives me limpetigo. You keep your bomb to yourself why don't you.
923 | 533 | 532 | I was speaking metafolicly as it happens.
924 | 535 | 534 | Well, that's as may be, Sir, but you mention that word again and I shall, I shall. . . well I shall not be answerable for my actions.
