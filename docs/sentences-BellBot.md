155 | 2293 | 2292 | Only woman I ever saw could suck the pips out of a pomegranate without cutting it open.
156 | 2295 | 2294 | Don't mention her to Fentible - his temperature goes up and he starts leaking brake fluid.
157 | 2343 | 2342 | Look dude. I'm a lifting-carrying-taking-doing kind of Bot. It's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
158 | 2345 | 2344 | Whatever you say. It's not my job to argue.
159 | 2347 | 2346 | Yea, well, like I said - it's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
160 | 2349 | 2348 | I'm not really very bright, am I?

169 | 3155 | 3154 | Ridden in it? I invented it.
170 | 3141 | 3140 | Nope. I'm a clean living bot.
171 | 3143 | 3142 | Like I said. I'm a clean living bot.
172 | 3111 | 3110 | Don't believe in 'em.
173 | 3071 | 3070 | If it moves I fancy it. I draw the line at two legs though.
174 | 3073 | 3072 | If it moves I dig it. I draw the line at two legs though.

180 | 1901 | 1900 | I'll come back when you're not such a wise-ass.
181 | 1903 | 1902 | We're not at home to mister rude.
182 | 1905 | 1904 | Just because I'm a bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
183 | 1907 | 1906 | I suppose you think I don't have feelings? Ha well I don't! Aren't I the luckiest thing in all creation.

187 | 2441 | 2440 | Hey I just don't see the point of that right now.
188 | 2443 | 2442 | You know something? I'm getting really bored by some of the stuff you're coming out with.
189 | 2445 | 2444 | Very interesting and also completely useless right now.
190 | 2447 | 2446 | Yeah so what if you're right - there's other stuff going on you should be getting involved with.
191 | 2449 | 2448 | You are really wasting time dude - you better get your act together.
192 | 2451 | 2450 | You know there's other stuff you should be getting your head round right now.
193 | 2453 | 2452 | Call me a rude BellBot if you will - but you ought to open your mind a little you know.
194 | 2455 | 2454 | I'm sure that's really interesting to you - but right now I think you ought to be getting on with other things - OK?
195 | 1965 | 1964 | Are you CRAZY? I'm not allowed to take TIPS! WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR?!
196 | 1967 | 1966 | They offered me a tip they offered me a tip they offered me a tip I'M IN A LOOP I'M IN A LOOP I'M IN A LOOP!

203 | 2319 | 2318 | Hey, you're first class aren't you? So what's with the negative attitude.
204 | 2321 | 2320 | Whinge whinge whinge - you guys in first class are all the same.
205 | 2323 | 2322 | Guess what my motto is. Never feel sorry for the guys in first class.
206 | 2311 | 2310 | Yeah well, look on the bright side. There's plenty of things you do like.
207 | 2313 | 2312 | Know something? If you were First Class, things like that wouldn't bother you.
208 | 2315 | 2314 | Yeah, it's too bad.
209 | 2317 | 2316 | I'm real sorry to hear that.
210 | 2303 | 2302 | What do I care? You're here on a freebie - you put up with it.
211 | 2305 | 2304 | You're SGT Class buddy - it's all part of the package.
212 | 2307 | 2306 | I'll let you in on a secret. I'm programmed to ignore complaints from 3rd Class passengers.
213 | 2309 | 2308 | Know something? If I were you I'd feel the same way.
214 | 3095 | 3094 | No, they get in the way of a bot's night life.
215 | 3097 | 3096 | I do have a pet hate - mahogany.
216 | 3099 | 3098 | Takes itself too seriously.
217 | 3085 | 3084 | No I don't believe I have.
218 | 3069 | 3068 | No, but then what do I know ?
219 | 1909 | 1908 | Your BellBot at your service.
220 | 1949 | 1948 | Well howdy doody.
221 | 1951 | 1950 | The pleasure's all yours. Ha.
222 | 1953 | 1952 | Well it would be - I'm kinda special.
223 | 1955 | 1954 | If it's OK with you I'll wait till I know you better before answering that.
224 | 1957 | 1956 | See how you feel at the end of the trip.
225 | 1911 | 1910 | Hi, Krage here. Best looking BellBot in the business.
226 | 1913 | 1912 | Hi. The name's Krage. Spelt K-O-O-L.
227 | 1915 | 1914 | Hey little guy, want to see something funny?
228 | 1917 | 1916 | Look. No batteries. Cool huh?
229 | 1931 | 1930 | Hi how's it hanging?
230 | 1933 | 1932 | Cool.
231 | 1935 | 1934 | Each to his own.
232 | 1937 | 1936 | Hey, aren't you the moody one?
233 | 1939 | 1938 | Yo! Surf's Up!
234 | 1941 | 1940 | You are soooooo literal.
235 | 1943 | 1942 | Greetings biped!
236 | 1945 | 1944 | Nice to meet you.
237 | 1947 | 1946 | Good to meet you too.
238 | 1625 | 1624 | Fentible's a real comedian. He says there's a body up in the First Class Restaurant.
239 | 1643 | 1642 | Hey I've seen starlings up on the Promenade Deck. Maybe we could squish them in the big fan they got up there?
240 | 1645 | 1644 | Any crap on this ship, you'll find it in the Super Galactic Traveler food system. Maybe that's where you'll find the starling pur$e?
241 | 1647 | 1646 | You want an upgrade, you suck up to Marsinta. Make sure she's on a good setting though or she'll have your borms for earplugs.
242 | 1649 | 1648 | You don't like me the way I am, you go down the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings. See if I care.
243 | 1651 | 1650 | You know anything about music?
244 | 1655 | 1654 | Well head for the Music Room and do some learning.
245 | 1653 | 1652 | Well head for the Music Room. You'll die for Boppy Headcase and the Laid-back Loafers.
246 | 1657 | 1656 | If you don't like the Super Galactic Traveler room, and I don't blame you, you want to get the in-flight magazine - it always has plenty of ideas on getting upgraded.
247 | 1659 | 1658 | You want to help? You work out why the cyberintelligence has gone crazy.
248 | 1661 | 1660 | Look, why don't you head up to Titania's Chamber? That's where all the controls are.
249 | 1663 | 1662 | You ought to check out the TV Channels. Last time I looked there was something very weird going on in one of the first class staterooms.
250 | 1665 | 1664 | What do you do when you find a body? Search it for clues, that's what you do.
251 | 1627 | 1626 | Fentible was telling me there's a body down in the Bilge Room.
252 | 1667 | 1666 | I don't want to rush you or anything but if I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
253 | 1669 | 1668 | You got to be pretty clever to defuse a bomb like that.
254 | 1671 | 1670 | Can you defuse the bomb?
255 | 1673 | 1672 | Oh yeah, like we did weaponry at BellBot school. Are you crazy?
256 | 1629 | 1628 | You ought to check out the Arboretum - I hear you can change the weather up there.
257 | 1631 | 1630 | You know where you get lemons? Lemon trees. And you know where you get lemon trees? The Arboretum.
258 | 1633 | 1632 | I think they've got lemons up in the Arboretum.
259 | 1635 | 1634 | If you're stuck for something to do you could always head up to the bar and see if you can help Fortillian with his Titanic Titillator.
260 | 1637 | 1636 | I bet this would be crushed to a pulp if I threw it from the Top of the Well.
261 | 1639 | 1638 | I've got a strange urge to throw a TV down the Well. I bet it'd make a radical sound!
262 | 1641 | 1640 | Yeah!!!!!!. You bet!!!!!! Smash the ship, smash the ship, smash the ship!!! BellBots are BAD!!!!!!!!!
263 | 3137 | 3136 | No. Work and play.
264 | 2083 | 2082 | To the left.
265 | 1971 | 1970 | How are you?

267 | 1975 | 1974 | I'm as happy as a worb.
268 | 1977 | 1976 | I'm pretty cool - how are you?
269 | 1979 | 1978 | Yeah well, just keep your feelings to yourself and we'll get along fine.
270 | 1987 | 1986 | I'm OK - what's it to you?
271 | 1989 | 1988 | Boy am I hung-over. Some guy left a grease-gun out last night and I just had to finish it.
272 | 1959 | 1958 | Fine, how are your things?
273 | 1961 | 1960 | Nice words butter no turnips. Only thing I trust is a good tip.
274 | 1963 | 1962 | Know what I like? TIPS! Do you give good tips?
275 | 1825 | 1824 | Good. That means I don't have to bother.
276 | 1829 | 1828 | If you really loved me - YOU'D STOP ASKING ALL THESE QUESTIONS!!
277 | 2151 | 2150 | kiss my
278 | 3125 | 3124 | Nope.
279 | 2081 | 2080 | A word in your ear - don't hang around in Elevators. That guy is seriously weird.
280 | 2085 | 2084 | Been talking to the LiftBot? I guess somebody has to.
281 | 2087 | 2086 | Something you should know: Nobby's got a big imagination and a lousy memory.
282 | 2089 | 2088 | Nobby's been giving you some of that big hero stuff eh? Yep, he's had wounds in places most butchers don't know exist.
283 | 3117 | 3116 | What's a lightbulb?
284 | 3119 | 3118 | Good. I hope that slight delay ruined the gag.
285 | 3147 | 3146 | Never seen any.
286 | 3093 | 3092 | Nope but what do I know.
287 | 1795 | 1794 | Maybe.
288 | 1821 | 1820 | Who cares?
289 | 1827 | 1826 | Know what I think? I think we should love each other more.
290 | 1797 | 1796 | Maybe, maybe not.
291 | 1799 | 1798 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
292 | 1801 | 1800 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
293 | 1803 | 1802 | Could be.
294 | 1805 | 1804 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
295 | 1815 | 1814 | Yes and no, no and yes, kind of iffy in-betweeny.
296 | 1817 | 1816 | Why does it always have to be yes or no, for or against, positive or negative, up on something, down on something - why can't we be all middly and wishy washy and sort of squidgy and just relax and flop about. Put it another way - I don't know.
297 | 1819 | 1818 | To be honest, I don't really care.
298 | 1889 | 1888 | Don't you know?
299 | 1891 | 1890 | Sorry, can't tell you.
300 | 1895 | 1894 | Hey you're lucky - I wish I could forget it.
301 | 1897 | 1896 | Sorry, can't tell you.
302 | 1893 | 1892 | Well you don't need me to tell you do you?
303 | 3121 | 3120 | I'm too hot for any membership list.
304 | 2285 | 2284 | I dunno. Some kind of propulsion type thing. What am I - a rocket scientist all of a sudden?
305 | 2281 | 2280 | Only the hottest property around. I went on vacation once with her brother's dentist's neighbor.
306 | 1841 | 1840 | Never.
307 | 1843 | 1842 | All the time.
308 | 1845 | 1844 | Sometimes.
309 | 1847 | 1846 | Often.
310 | 1849 | 1848 | Occasionally.
311 | 1851 | 1850 | Hardly ever.
312 | 1853 | 1852 | When the mood's right.
313 | 1859 | 1858 | That'll be the day.
314 | 1861 | 1860 | From time to time.
315 | 2259 | 2258 | Nib? The biggest, most astounding, dangerous, skilful, horrific game in the galaxy. Ask the BarBot - he's the fan around here.
316 | 1747 | 1746 | No.
317 | 1765 | 1764 | No way.
318 | 1767 | 1766 | You gotta be kidding.
319 | 1769 | 1768 | Never.
320 | 1771 | 1770 | No chance.
321 | 1773 | 1772 | Not a hope.
322 | 1775 | 1774 | Nope.
323 | 1777 | 1776 | Out of the question.
324 | 1779 | 1778 | You are way off beam.
325 | 1781 | 1780 | Wrong.
326 | 1783 | 1782 | Bong! And the punter with the greasy skin asks another dumbass question and is kicked off the team!
327 | 1749 | 1748 | No no no no no no no!!!!
328 | 1785 | 1784 | Ding! And the little guy with the foot odor problem lets down the team with a staggeringly stupid question!
329 | 1787 | 1786 | That is a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb question. No.
330 | 1789 | 1788 | Dumb dumb dumb dumb.
331 | 1791 | 1790 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
332 | 1793 | 1792 | The answer's no. Funny, you were quite a bright being before you got upgraded.
333 | 1751 | 1750 | No.
334 | 1753 | 1752 | No.
335 | 1755 | 1754 | No.
336 | 1757 | 1756 | No.
337 | 1759 | 1758 | No.
338 | 1761 | 1760 | No.
339 | 1763 | 1762 | Nah.
340 | 2257 | 2256 | Whatever it is I don't want to know. When I go, I want it to be a surprise.
341 | 1863 | 1862 | I'm sure you're right.
342 | 1865 | 1864 | Damn, I'm good.
343 | 1867 | 1866 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
344 | 1869 | 1868 | Absolutely.
345 | 1871 | 1870 | Without a doubt.
346 | 1873 | 1872 | Do worbs lick their trails?
347 | 1875 | 1874 | Kinda pet. Leaves slime everywhere.
348 | 1877 | 1876 | Little furry pet. Leaves slime everywhere. Lives forever.
349 | 1879 | 1878 | Does the Gat wear a hat?
350 | 1883 | 1882 | Do you know nothing? Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
351 | 1881 | 1880 | Nothing important. Just the guy who runs the whole of Blerontis.
352 | 1885 | 1884 | Well you've got me there. Afraid I just don't know.
353 | 1887 | 1886 | Look, I'm just a Bot. I get things, I take things. I don't know the meaning of life or anything. Well obviously I know the meaning of life - who doesn't? What I'm trying to say is sometimes I just can't help you.
354 | 3101 | 3100 | Only the parrot.

390 | 2415 | 2414 | Try Titania's Room.
391 | 2379 | 2378 | Well.
392 | 1923 | 1922 | At the risk of repeating myself...
393 | 1925 | 1924 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again...
394 | 1927 | 1926 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times...
395 | 1929 | 1928 | Didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that, didn't you just say that? See what it's like having to hear the same thing over and over and over and over and over...
396 | 1807 | 1806 | Good question. Best one so far. Shame I don't know the answer.
397 | 1809 | 1808 | Good question. Not as good as the last one, but still very good.
398 | 1811 | 1810 | Now that's what I call a real question. I can't answer it but it's a real question all right.
399 | 1813 | 1812 | Good question. Very good question. Brilliant question. Astounding question. What was it again?
400 | 1831 | 1830 | If you really cared for me you wouldn't need to ask me that.
401 | 1833 | 1832 | How can you ask me that knowing what happened to me on Filigon Four?
402 | 2819 | 2818 | Al q'Hamra.
403 | 2821 | 2820 | Vortigan.
404 | 2823 | 2822 | Genneth.
405 | 2825 | 2824 | Bristil.
406 | 2827 | 2826 | Splod.
407 | 2829 | 2828 | Tarbert.
408 | 2831 | 2830 | Voedio.
409 | 2833 | 2832 | Hwhifft.
410 | 2817 | 2816 | The quonth is:
411 | 2835 | 2834 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
412 | 2837 | 2836 | Forty-two? I never said that.
413 | 3165 | 3164 | The only science I care about is the science of keeping the party hot, the beer cold and the chicks warm.
414 | 3167 | 3166 | Who'd be a scientist? Me I'm a consumer and proud of it.
415 | 1919 | 1918 | You're repeating yourself.
416 | 1921 | 1920 | You ought to be careful. Repetition is the first sign of madness the first sign of madness the first sign of madness the first sign of madness. Ha.
417 | 3077 | 3076 | Probably. Can't quite remember the details though.
418 | 3089 | 3088 | Even if I had would I share my opinion with you.
419 | 3091 | 3090 | I don't get time off on this job.
420 | 3075 | 3074 | It's quite likely.
421 | 2325 | 2324 | If you ask me, you're the smartass round here.
422 | 2327 | 2326 | Nothing. Just passing the time of day.
423 | 2251 | 2250 | Smorbit's about so big.
424 | 3123 | 3122 | Me and clubs don't mix.
425 | 2267 | 2266 | It's a language interface dumbnuts.
426 | 2279 | 2278 | Starlight's a big travel company back on Blerontin.
427 | 2129 | 2128 | but I'm not too sure.
428 | 2147 | 2146 | but I'm having a spot of trouble working out
429 | 2149 | 2148 | but
430 | 2131 | 2130 | but I'm not quite certain.
431 | 2133 | 2132 | but I can't quite recall.
432 | 2135 | 2134 | but I'm having a teeny weeeny bit of trouble remembering.
433 | 2137 | 2136 | but it's kinda slipped the old memory.
434 | 2139 | 2138 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
435 | 2141 | 2140 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
436 | 2143 | 2142 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
437 | 2145 | 2144 | but I couldn't say with rock-solid slithium-coated certainty.
438 | 2111 | 2110 | and I know you'll never understand
439 | 2113 | 2112 | and I know you'd never take it personally
440 | 2115 | 2114 | and don't you go blaming the old Titanic for it
441 | 2117 | 2116 | and I'll take it on the nose myself for it
442 | 2119 | 2118 | and don't even think about sticking it on someone
443 | 2121 | 2120 | and don't you take it personal
444 | 2123 | 2122 | and you'd better not shout it round the ship OK?
445 | 2125 | 2124 | and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally
446 | 2127 | 2126 | and I'd say this to any guy on board
447 | 2153 | 2152 | how.
448 | 2171 | 2170 | why you think that.
449 | 2173 | 2172 | why you're going to do that.
450 | 2175 | 2174 | why you keep asking these dumbass questions.
451 | 2177 | 2176 | why you think that's relevant.
452 | 2179 | 2178 | why you persist in being a jerk.
453 | 2181 | 2180 | why you insist on acting stupid.
454 | 2183 | 2182 | why you act so weird.
455 | 2185 | 2184 | who.
456 | 2187 | 2186 | who you mean.
457 | 2189 | 2188 | who did it.
458 | 2155 | 2154 | how it works.
459 | 2191 | 2190 | who moved it.
460 | 2193 | 2192 | who took it.
461 | 2195 | 2194 | who hid it.
462 | 2197 | 2196 | where.
463 | 2199 | 2198 | where it is.
464 | 2201 | 2200 | where they are.
465 | 2203 | 2202 | where it went.
466 | 2205 | 2204 | where they went.
467 | 2207 | 2206 | where it could be
468 | 2209 | 2208 | where they could be
469 | 2157 | 2156 | how you might solve that.
470 | 2211 | 2210 | where he went.
471 | 2213 | 2212 | where they went.
472 | 2215 | 2214 | where he is.
473 | 2217 | 2216 | where they are.
474 | 2219 | 2218 | when.
475 | 2221 | 2220 | when we're going to arrive.
476 | 2223 | 2222 | when that happened.
477 | 2225 | 2224 | when - if at all.
478 | 2227 | 2226 | when that'll happen.
479 | 2229 | 2228 | what.
480 | 2159 | 2158 | how you might get that
481 | 2231 | 2230 | what that is.
482 | 2233 | 2232 | what you ought to do with it.
483 | 2235 | 2234 | what it does.
484 | 2237 | 2236 | what they do.
485 | 2239 | 2238 | what he does.
486 | 2241 | 2240 | what she does.
487 | 2243 | 2242 | what I mean any more.
488 | 2161 | 2160 | how you might get them
489 | 2163 | 2162 | how you might go there.
490 | 2165 | 2164 | why.
491 | 2167 | 2166 | why that happens.
492 | 2169 | 2168 | why you want to do that.
493 | 2091 | 2090 | The thing is
494 | 2109 | 2108 | It makes me feel bad to have to say this
495 | 2093 | 2092 | The trouble is
496 | 2095 | 2094 | Kick me if I've said this before
497 | 2097 | 2096 | It's sorta embarrassing
498 | 2099 | 2098 | I feel like a real worb saying this
499 | 2101 | 2100 | Odd thing is
500 | 2103 | 2102 | Funny thing is
501 | 2105 | 2104 | This isn't logical
502 | 2107 | 2106 | This is something I never thought I'd say
503 | 3105 | 3104 | Have you tried changing his setting?
504 | 3079 | 3078 | No, I don't believe I have.
505 | 2801 | 2800 | Hey man I was talking!
506 | 2803 | 2802 | Hey don't butt in - all right?
507 | 2805 | 2804 | Well you go right ahead and say your piece - see if I care.
508 | 2807 | 2806 | I wasn't saying anything important anyway.
509 | 2809 | 2808 | Don't mind me.
510 | 2811 | 2810 | Do you have to keep interrupting?
511 | 2813 | 2812 | Are you ever going to let me finish?
512 | 2815 | 2814 | I was talking to myself anyway.
513 | 2599 | 2598 | That looks like a note.

579 | 2721 | 2720 | That's some kind of phonograph I guess.
580 | 2563 | 2562 | It's a Photograph.
581 | 2701 | 2700 | That's a rather useful photograph of the night sky.
582 | 2715 | 2714 | That's Boppy Headcase himself at the piano-like thing.
583 | 2625 | 2624 | Hey, they're pistachio nuts.
584 | 2685 | 2684 | That's the special Plinth.

589 | 2763 | 2762 | That's the SCSI Cable. Don't ask me what it's for. Art, I guess.
590 | 2567 | 2566 | That's called the Send Yourself Plug-in.
591 | 2655 | 2654 | That's the Send Yourself Plug-In.
592 | 2771 | 2770 | That's your television.
593 | 2711 | 2710 | I don't know what it's called but it looks like a sort of snakey blowey thing to me.
594 | 2525 | 2524 | That's a Flock Of Starlings.
595 | 2745 | 2744 | That looks like a flock of starlings to me, wow!
596 | 2667 | 2666 | That's a statue of Brobostigon.
597 | 2665 | 2664 | That's a statue of Leovinus.
598 | 2669 | 2668 | That's a statue of Scraliontis.

602 | 2683 | 2682 | That's a Succ-U-Bus.
603 | 2575 | 2574 | I guess those are Sweets.
604 | 2577 | 2576 | I guess that's candy.
605 | 2727 | 2726 | That looks like one of Titania's Ears.
606 | 2795 | 2794 | That is Titania.
607 | 2511 | 2510 | Looks to me like one of Titania's Ears.
608 | 2627 | 2626 | That looks like Titania's Ear to me.
609 | 2611 | 2610 | That looks like one of Titania's Eyes.
610 | 2519 | 2518 | That's one of Titania's Eyes all right.
611 | 2673 | 2672 | That looks to me like one of Titania's Eyes.
612 | 2541 | 2540 | I do believe that's Titania's Mouth.
613 | 2543 | 2542 | That's Titania's Mouth.
614 | 2695 | 2694 | That looks to me like Titania's Mouth.
615 | 2551 | 2550 | That looks like Titania's Nose.
616 | 2737 | 2736 | That's Titania's Nose I guess.
617 | 2513 | 2512 | Looks to me like Titania's other Ear.

622 | 2641 | 2640 | That looks like the Vision Center.
623 | 2713 | 2712 | What are they - some kind of tubular bells?
624 | 2579 | 2578 | That's a Television.
625 | 2607 | 2606 | That's one of the TV's.
626 | 2643 | 2642 | Looks like a television to me.
627 | 2707 | 2706 | That's a television if I'm not mistaken.
628 | 2741 | 2740 | That's just a television.
629 | 2609 | 2608 | That's the other TV.
630 | 2791 | 2790 | Those are televisions.
631 | 2631 | 2630 | I guess those are the Weather Controls.
632 | 2629 | 2628 | This is the Arboretum.
633 | 2637 | 2636 | This is the Bar.
634 | 2657 | 2656 | This is the Bottom Of The Well.

636 | 2663 | 2662 | This is called the Creators Chamber.
637 | 2787 | 2786 | This is a short corridor - what does it look like?

642 | 2605 | 2604 | This is a First Class Stateroom.
643 | 2699 | 2698 | This is your lovely home.
644 | 2709 | 2708 | This is the Music Room and you're looking at Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers.
645 | 2743 | 2742 | This is the Promenade Deck - just the place for a good stroll.
646 | 2729 | 2728 | This is the Parrot Lobby.
647 | 2751 | 2750 | This is the Sculpture Chamber.

659 | 2841 | 2840 | Hammerday.
660 | 2843 | 2842 | Rowday.
661 | 2845 | 2844 | Welday.
662 | 2847 | 2846 | Harday.
663 | 2849 | 2848 | Spryday.
664 | 2851 | 2850 | Otherday.
665 | 2853 | 2852 | Flatterday.
666 | 2855 | 2854 | Umph.
667 | 2839 | 2838 | Today is:
668 | 2463 | 2462 | Why don't you see what's going down in the Arboretum?
669 | 2465 | 2464 | Maybe you should head up to the Bar?
670 | 2471 | 2470 | Well, you've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
671 | 2467 | 2466 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
672 | 2469 | 2468 | Why don't you check out the Bilge Room again?
673 | 2473 | 2472 | I don't recollect seeing you in the Creators Chamber - there's some weird stuff in there all right.
674 | 2475 | 2474 | You ought to take an Elevator - get a real fix on the ship.
675 | 2477 | 2476 | Why not get over to the Embarkation Lobby and go head to head with Marsinta?
676 | 2457 | 2456 | Well, it just might be worth taking a trip up to the First Class Restaurant.
677 | 2459 | 2458 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
678 | 2479 | 2478 | Take a boat down the Grand Canal - who knows what might turn up?
679 | 2481 | 2480 | Check out the Music Room and let Boppy Headcase open your ears.
680 | 2485 | 2484 | Take a leg-loosener round the Promenade Deck - who knows what might happen?
681 | 2483 | 2482 | You know the room with the Parrot? Well there's some odd stuff going on in there you know.
682 | 2487 | 2486 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue - but then, what do I know?
683 | 2461 | 2460 | Maybe you ought to have a good sniff round your Second Class Stateroom.
684 | 2489 | 2488 | You ought to get to grips with your SGT Bedroom - don't let the thing beat you man.
685 | 2491 | 2490 | If you haven't checked out the SGT Lounge well now's the time.
686 | 2493 | 2492 | The SGT Restaurant may not have the best food in town but things definitely aren't what they seem in there.
687 | 2501 | 2500 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get a fix on things.
688 | 2495 | 2494 | Far as I know you haven't checked out Titania's Room. Know what? You're really missing something there.
689 | 2499 | 2498 | Hey, try Titania's Room.
690 | 2497 | 2496 | I think you ought to give Titania's Room another look-over.
691 | 2247 | 2246 | It's a fluffy pet popular amongst old people and plumbers.
692 | 2249 | 2248 | It's good for cleaning pipes. Struggles a lot - I guess that's why it's so effective.
693 | 2287 | 2286 | The hottest, the latest, the fastest, the coolest, the bestest - you're talking major league BellBot here.
694 | 2431 | 2430 | Yeah well you shouldn't believe everything you hear in bars should you. Maybe it's time to change the BarBot's settings. Why don't you head over to the Sculpture Chamber and do just that?
695 | 2433 | 2432 | Fortillian told you that I had it - did he?
696 | 2435 | 2434 | Well sorry, I do not have the vision center. BarBot's playing games again. If I were you I'd go to the Sculpture Chamber and check out his honesty setting. Sounds to me like it's slipped a little.
697 | 2437 | 2436 | Look buddy, this is getting neither of us nowhere fast. GO to the Sculpture Chamber! Get hold of Fortillian's honesty lever! Crank it hard as you can then head back to the bar and get some sense out of him while you can. Capisce!!!???????
698 | 2009 | 2008 | Well? Got a job for me?
699 | 2011 | 2010 | You guest, me servant. You order, me obey - Capisce?
700 | 2013 | 2012 | OK you wanna play it the hard way? I'll come back when you want to talk to me...
701 | 2015 | 2014 | Hey! Remember me?
702 | 2017 | 2016 | Hey! Did you ever lay an egg?
703 | 2021 | 2020 | Well, don't knock it till you've tried it.
704 | 2019 | 2018 | Feels good don't it.
705 | 2023 | 2022 | Silence. Don't you just love it?
706 | 2025 | 2024 | Nothing worse than a noisy room eh?
707 | 2027 | 2026 | Boy it's hard to stop you talking.
708 | 2029 | 2028 | Kinda spooky with no other passengers isn't it?
709 | 2031 | 2030 | Where? Where? Where? Where? Where? Where?
710 | 2033 | 2032 | Must be a galactic record - ship this size going AWOL before she's even picked up the passengers.
711 | 3135 | 3134 | I'm too popular - just never in.
712 | 1991 | 1990 | Nice weather we're having.
713 | 1993 | 1992 | Are you crazy? The only good weather is no weather.
714 | 1995 | 1994 | What kind of dumb-ass statement is that? No-one likes weather.
715 | 1997 | 1996 | Weather's illogical.
716 | 1999 | 1998 | You like weather? Weird.
717 | 2001 | 2000 | If you like weather - we've got all sorts here.
718 | 2003 | 2002 | Are you crazy? We're on a Starship. Starships don't have weather.
719 | 2005 | 2004 | Hey guys we got lucky! It's the Conversationalist of the Year!
720 | 2007 | 2006 | Hey if you're a weather fan you ought to head up to the Arboretum - you can get off on all kinds of weather for free.
721 | 2253 | 2252 | Bilge? Crapooli. Rubbola. Lies and deceptions.
722 | 2587 | 2586 | It's a trans-Galactic liner.
723 | 2573 | 2572 | It sucks, it blows and anything else, it doesn't knows.
724 | 3183 | 3182 | Whatever.
725 | 3179 | 3178 | Just what it says it is, plug it in and you can send yourself.
726 | 2585 | 2584 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
727 | 3153 | 3152 | Who knows?
728 | 2583 | 2582 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
729 | 2329 | 2328 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
730 | 2331 | 2330 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
731 | 2333 | 2332 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS UP HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
732 | 2335 | 2334 | HEY FENTIBLE!!!! GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!
733 | 3181 | 3180 | Wherever you want.
734 | 3163 | 3162 | Blerontis.
735 | 3157 | 3156 | You never been to a bar? Kinda logical place to start looking.
736 | 3161 | 3160 | Wouldn't I like to know? Got wiped clean at the factory so I can't tell you.
737 | 1899 | 1898 | Krage Koyotaal at your service.
738 | 2337 | 2336 | Brobostigon? Fat guy in charge of building the ship.
739 | 1823 | 1822 | I do... I care...
740 | 2339 | 2338 | Leovinus is way out of your league. He's the guy who created this floating coffin. I mean wondrous Starship.
741 | 2341 | 2340 | Scraliontis? He's the Accountant.
742 | 3109 | 3108 | What do I care.
743 | 1675 | 1674 | Oh yeah, right on!
744 | 1693 | 1692 | Yes. Or do I mean no? Ha only kidding. It's yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
745 | 1695 | 1694 | No. All right. Yes.
746 | 1697 | 1696 | You are so right.
747 | 1699 | 1698 | Yea. Cool.
748 | 1701 | 1700 | For a guy from a dirt planet you're pretty bright.
749 | 1703 | 1702 | What's a dirt planet?
750 | 1705 | 1704 | You never asked yourself why they called it - Earth?
751 | 1707 | 1706 | Fine by me.
752 | 1709 | 1708 | Help yourself.
753 | 1711 | 1710 | Right.
754 | 1677 | 1676 | Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
755 | 1713 | 1712 | Yes indeedy.
756 | 1715 | 1714 | Sure looks that way.
757 | 1717 | 1716 | You better believe it.
758 | 1719 | 1718 | Of course.
759 | 1721 | 1720 | Go ahead.
760 | 1723 | 1722 | Do what you want.
761 | 1725 | 1724 | Definitely.
762 | 1727 | 1726 | Not a doubt.
763 | 1729 | 1728 | It's a sure thing.
764 | 1731 | 1730 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
765 | 1679 | 1678 | Yes.
766 | 1733 | 1732 | Yes. Or as the people of Chan would say: No.
767 | 1735 | 1734 | No-one's ever been to Chan - ass-holes always give you the wrong directions.
768 | 1737 | 1736 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in third class gets another question right!
769 | 1739 | 1738 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in second class gets another question right!
770 | 1741 | 1740 | Bong! And the little guy with the funny hair in first class gets another question right!
771 | 1743 | 1742 | Yes folks it's major breakthrough time here on the Starship Titanic as the all-time loser in the vest with the egg-stains GETS A QUESTION RIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!
772 | 1745 | 1744 | Bong! Another astonishingly correct answer!
773 | 1681 | 1680 | Yes.
774 | 1683 | 1682 | Yes.
775 | 1685 | 1684 | Yes.
776 | 1687 | 1686 | Yes.
777 | 1689 | 1688 | Yes.
778 | 1691 | 1690 | Yeah.
779 | 3081 | 3080 | You know me - I like everything.
780 | 3827 | 3826 | You may not be able to fix D'Astragaar - but you could sure as hell find out what happened to him.
781 | 3821 | 3820 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Cool lighting don't you think?
782 | 3823 | 3822 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Groovy lighting don't you think?
783 | 3547 | 3546 | Have you found your room?
784 | 3551 | 3550 | Just stand by a room and check its number in your PET if you're having trouble.
785 | 3549 | 3548 | How about those pistachios - nice huh? Lucky that damned parrot hasn't found them yet?
786 | 3817 | 3816 | To be real honest - this area's kinda dull. Why not check out your room?
787 | 3553 | 3552 | Hey, they got pistachios. You ought to eat those up before the parrot gets them.
788 | 3555 | 3554 | If you're getting fed up eating the pistachios, I guess you could always call in a parrot strike.
789 | 3819 | 3818 | Funny, I never really noticed how strange the bowls were before.
790 | 3901 | 3900 | Time you figured out how to fix Titania I guess.
791 | 3953 | 3952 | Got any more TV's, that was fun!
792 | 3925 | 3924 | Ouch!
793 | 3927 | 3926 | Don't do that!
794 | 3929 | 3928 | Hey man! That hurt!
795 | 3931 | 3930 | Don't prod me. OK?
796 | 3933 | 3932 | Prod me again and I'm outta here.
797 | 3511 | 3510 | All you got to do here is help Fortillian mix the cocktail. Easy.
798 | 3513 | 3512 | Mmm. I guess the best thing you can do is look round the ship for the ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
799 | 3825 | 3824 | Why talk to me when you could be talking to a real expert - Fortillian.
800 | 3465 | 3464 | If I were you I'd check to make sure the big Succ-U-Bus is working.
801 | 3469 | 3468 | Quick. Search the body.
802 | 3467 | 3466 | Sounds to me like the Big Mother's got something stuck in its throat. You need to make it sneeze it out somehow.
803 | 3471 | 3470 | Check the fat guy's pockets.
804 | 3797 | 3796 | This is where the stuff that nobody wants turns up. Check it out real careful.
805 | 3253 | 3252 | The Big Mother's the mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Lives in the Bilge Room.
806 | 3255 | 3254 | The fat guy in the Succ-U-Bus is Brobostigon. Or should I say was.
807 | 3881 | 3880 | Hey, don't suppose you've managed to disarm that bomb yet have you?
808 | 3883 | 3882 | Bomb's about to go off. Just thought you might want to know.
809 | 3503 | 3502 | Mmm. If Nobby's head's down here - maybe you ought to check out the Elevators to see what's been stuck in its place?
810 | 3505 | 3504 | Now who was talking to me about TV's? Yea, I know - the BarBot.
811 | 3853 | 3852 | Brobostigon.
812 | 3787 | 3786 | Yes even an amateur such as yourself may alter my settings. Just head for the sculpture Chamber and start pulling the levers.
813 | 3303 | 3302 | Easy. All you got to do is get to the Bridge.
814 | 3607 | 3606 | That was the general idea. I sure hope you've got it in you.
815 | 3313 | 3312 | Yeah I know. That's the funny thing: I was only kidding about it being useful. Are you crazy - trying to navigate across the universe using a photo of the sky above your house. Ha.
816 | 3315 | 3314 | You can use it for looking at. That's about all it's good for.
817 | 3317 | 3316 | You'd have to ask the navigator.
818 | 3321 | 3320 | It can help keep your spirits up can't it?
819 | 3283 | 3282 | Put a chicken under the spout. Then put your glass under the chicken. The sauce will slide off the chicken into the glass.
820 | 3201 | 3200 | Fentible doesn't have access to all areas. Whereas me - I can go almost any place. Except the Bridge of course.
821 | 3289 | 3288 | Romantic notion. Probably predates lawyers.
822 | 3493 | 3492 | OK. If the lever's not working maybe the damn thing's blown a fuse.
823 | 3495 | 3494 | If you ask me you'll never figure out this place till you get the lever to work.
824 | 3497 | 3496 | This is where the top guys had all their meetings. You want to access those TV's I guess you'll need a password.
825 | 3233 | 3232 | Just pull the lever.
826 | 3235 | 3234 | Maybe it's blown a fuse.
827 | 3237 | 3236 | This is where the big cheeses used to have their pow wows - somewhere in here is their communications system.
828 | 3807 | 3806 | This room was used by the guys who ran things round here - my bet is it's full of secrets and codes.
829 | 3239 | 3238 | The lever over there operates the beams I guess.
830 | 3231 | 3230 | You're looking at the three big cheeses there: Leovinus, Scraliontis and Brobostigon.
831 | 3775 | 3774 | Yeah! There go my settings. Yessssssssssssss.
832 | 3777 | 3776 | Uh-oh. There go my settings.
833 | 3779 | 3778 | Yesssssssssssss! There go my settings again.
834 | 3781 | 3780 | Uh-oh. There go my settings again.
835 | 3273 | 3272 | Maybe you should find something to wipe the chicken?
836 | 3263 | 3262 | You know they got all kinds of controls and stuff in Titania's Chamber: Maybe they run the chickens from there.
837 | 3949 | 3948 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
838 | 3951 | 3950 | I'm relaxing as quickly as I can.
839 | 3323 | 3322 | Cough, cough, cough...
840 | 3871 | 3870 | D'Astragaar.
841 | 3831 | 3830 | Hey - did you find that thing you were looking for?
842 | 3373 | 3372 | Down there.
843 | 3391 | 3390 | Down there.
844 | 3389 | 3388 | In the Elevator.
845 | 3407 | 3406 | In the Elevator.
846 | 3383 | 3382 | Then straight ahead.
847 | 3401 | 3400 | Then straight ahead.
848 | 3379 | 3378 | Then left.
849 | 3397 | 3396 | Then left.
850 | 3381 | 3380 | Then right.
851 | 3399 | 3398 | Then right.
852 | 3385 | 3384 | Through the doors.
853 | 3403 | 3402 | Through the doors.
854 | 3375 | 3374 | Turn left.
855 | 3393 | 3392 | Turn left.
856 | 3377 | 3376 | Turn right.
857 | 3395 | 3394 | Turn right.
858 | 3387 | 3386 | Up the steps.
859 | 3405 | 3404 | Up the steps.
860 | 3977 | 3976 | I hate the fall. All the trees are bare.
861 | 3973 | 3972 | I hate the spring. Makes my nose all runny and I sneeze all the time.
862 | 3975 | 3974 | I hate the summer. Too darn hot.
863 | 3971 | 3970 | I don't like winter. I hate it when the canal freezes over.
864 | 3913 | 3912 | Earlier.
865 | 3473 | 3472 | First of all - if I were you I'd check out this level then head on down to your room.
866 | 3475 | 3474 | Mmm - let me think. The Starship Titanic is drifting helplessly through hyperspace; the central intelligence of the ship has been cruelly torn apart by unknown hands; We Bots are unable to solve the problem ourselves. Perhaps you should be GETTING OFF YOUR ASS AND DOING SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE AND WE ALL DIE? Just an idea, of course.
867 | 3477 | 3476 | Do what new passengers always do - wander round looking dumb and wishing you'd bought 1st Class.
868 | 3479 | 3478 | Maybe you should find your room then check out the upgrade situation.
869 | 3801 | 3800 | It's kinda traditional, I know, but we like it that way.
870 | 3353 | 3352 | That's the DeskBot.
871 | 3351 | 3350 | That's the door to the Service Elevator.
872 | 3355 | 3354 | That's the door to The Top of the Well.
873 | 3799 | 3798 | This is where you check in. And of course make friends with Marsinta.
874 | 3617 | 3616 | Elevator 1
875 | 3619 | 3618 | Elevator 2
876 | 3621 | 3620 | Elevator 3
877 | 3623 | 3622 | Elevator 4
878 | 3625 | 3624 | -
879 | 3937 | 3936 | Maybe it's just blown a fuse?
880 | 3445 | 3444 | If you ask, I'll be happy to get it for you.
881 | 3519 | 3518 | You're going to have to get on the right side of D'Astragaar if you ask me.
882 | 3521 | 3520 | Mmm. Just between you and me - how about changing this damned music?
883 | 3523 | 3522 | Somehow you're going to have to force D'Astragaar to let you check out the tables.
884 | 3257 | 3256 | There must be a music player round here somewhere - I guess all you have to do is just change it.
885 | 3443 | 3442 | That light sure looks odd to me.
886 | 3515 | 3514 | Maybe you should check out the TV Channels.
887 | 3517 | 3516 | Maybe you should check out some of the other 1st Class rooms.
888 | 3867 | 3866 | Fentible.

931 | 3865 | 3864 | Fortillian.
932 | 3943 | 3942 | You can send small things through the Succ-U-Bus - so don't waste my time with menial tasks.
933 | 3187 | 3186 | Hey man, you're looking lost. Can I help?
934 | 3189 | 3188 | Yo! Krage to the rescue! Got any fetching? Got any carrying?
935 | 3191 | 3190 | Hi. Just passing through. Anything I can do for you?
936 | 3193 | 3192 | Want some help?
937 | 3195 | 3194 | Anything I can do?
938 | 3197 | 3196 | You look like you could do with some help.
939 | 3199 | 3198 | Yo. You look like you need Krage.
940 | 3185 | 3184 | Hey man, I know somewhere you've not been yet - the Bilge Room. I bet there's loads of stuff down there.
941 | 3961 | 3960 | Take a stroll round the Arboretum. If you don't think it's looking cool at this time of year, choose another one.
942 | 3957 | 3956 | Maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the Music Room.
943 | 3959 | 3958 | There's an awful row going on in the music room. Maybe you could make it better. You couldn't make it worse.
944 | 3447 | 3446 | I'm pretty good, how about you?
945 | 3451 | 3450 | Hey! Given there's nobody flying this thing you were lucky we hit it at all.
946 | 3449 | 3448 | Oh yeah? Well I guess what you don't know can't upset you.
947 | 3267 | 3266 | Maybe you should check out the little control box in Titania's Chamber?
948 | 3215 | 3214 | Well, you're just going to have to kick his ass.
949 | 3305 | 3304 | First you have to know where it is.
950 | 3277 | 3276 | You'll need to put a chicken under the spout or the sauce won't come out.
951 | 3609 | 3608 | Just a question of who you know.
952 | 3899 | 3898 | I was kinda hoping you'd know how to do that.
953 | 3251 | 3250 | Remember the Elevator you took to get into the ship? Just hop in and press one of the buttons.
954 | 3587 | 3586 | Just check out the Top of the Well.
955 | 3589 | 3588 | Take one of the Elevators and ask a LiftBot. They're real helpful.
956 | 3601 | 3600 | I prefer the word doomed. Kinda dramatic isn't it?
957 | 3963 | 3962 | There's only one Arboretum.
958 | 3965 | 3964 | There are four seasons, of course. How many did you expect?
959 | 3269 | 3268 | Maybe you could make the chicken less tasty. What about putting mustard on it?
960 | 3413 | 3412 | If you want to call the Elevator, use your PET - it's got a nice Elevator picture in control mode.
961 | 3325 | 3324 | Hummm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm...
962 | 3459 | 3458 | I'm so excited for you.
963 | 3917 | 3916 | If you hurry you might just make it.
964 | 3905 | 3904 | Immediately.
965 | 3941 | 3940 | In the Bilge Room.
966 | 3829 | 3828 | Probably. Whole damn ship's turning into a puzzle if you ask me.
967 | 3915 | 3914 | Just missed it.
968 | 3879 | 3878 | Koyotaal. The Fourth.
969 | 3863 | 3862 | Krage.
970 | 3877 | 3876 | Krage.
971 | 3875 | 3874 | Krage Koyotaal IV.
972 | 3911 | 3910 | Later.
973 | 3851 | 3850 | Leovinus.
974 | 3499 | 3498 | I think one of the Elevators is broken. Have you figured out which one yet?
975 | 3501 | 3500 | Fentible was telling me he saw a LiftBot head down in the Bottom of the Well. You been down there yet?
976 | 3869 | 3868 | Marsinta.
977 | 3859 | 3858 | Me.
978 | 3507 | 3506 | Whoa! This place is way too complicated for me. Ask Fentible.
979 | 3509 | 3508 | Music Room's beyond me man. Fentible's the music expert round here.
980 | 3327 | 3326 | Mumble mumble...
981 | 3329 | 3328 | Mumble mumble...
982 | 3331 | 3330 | Mumble mumble...
983 | 3333 | 3332 | Mumble mumble...
984 | 3461 | 3460 | I guess as names go it could be worse.
985 | 3463 | 3462 | Mmm. If you're expecting sympathy you've come to the wrong Bot.
986 | 3221 | 3220 | Course if you could get an upgrade - you could have a lot of fun in there.
987 | 3247 | 3246 | Woa! You'll need an upgrade before they let you in there.
988 | 3249 | 3248 | No entry to passengers of your class.
989 | 3903 | 3902 | Never.
990 | 3979 | 3978 | Hi, I'm Krage, I'm your BellBot today. Hey, I see you're not carrying any luggage. That's great! I can take a little time off, right away. And I see you're SuperGalactic Traveler class, so I guess you can find your own way to your room. The door's over there, the Elevator's around someplace. Relax! Stay cool! Enjoy!
991 | 3455 | 3454 | Yeah. I know.
992 | 3453 | 3452 | Hey! You like weather you ought to check out the Arboretum.
993 | 3847 | 3846 | I don't think it's important.
994 | 3217 | 3216 | Sorry. That's off limits to 2nd Class. They only let the big spenders in there.
995 | 3219 | 3218 | Sorry. That's off limits to 3rd class.
996 | 3223 | 3222 | Sorry man. They don't let riff-raff in there. I mean Super Galactic Traveler Class.
997 | 3955 | 3954 | Ok-damn-dokey.
998 | 3525 | 3524 | Mmm. Starlings - fan. Fan - starlings. I think there could be quite a useful connection here. Kinda thing the BarBot would be interested in.
999 | 3527 | 3526 | Is the fan switch working properly? Maybe the fuse has gone.
1000 | 3259 | 3258 | I guess the fuse is in the fuse box in Titania's Chamber.
1001 | 3485 | 3484 | There's something funny about that cage. I think you need to get the parrot out of the way.
1002 | 3487 | 3486 | Maybe you could give the parrot something to eat - that way you could reach in and grab the perch.
1003 | 3363 | 3362 | Maybe the perch is important.
1004 | 3365 | 3364 | Maybe you should check your baggage?
1005 | 3367 | 3366 | I think there's something in the lampshade. You're gonna have to - I don't know - blow it out somehow.
1006 | 3369 | 3368 | What you need is a giant blower. You need something that blows like the Succ-U-Bus on a bad day.
1007 | 3371 | 3370 | If only you could connect up the Succ-U-Bus to the lamp.
1008 | 3357 | 3356 | That's the parrot.
1009 | 3361 | 3360 | That's a perch.
1010 | 3359 | 3358 | That's the Succ-U-Bus.
1011 | 3805 | 3804 | This room's weird. Parrots, sticks, funny perches - grab what you can.
1012 | 3747 | 3746 | If you stand outside a room then look in Designer Room Number mode of your PET you'll find out exactly where your are.
1013 | 3935 | 3934 | Sorry, was that some feeble attempt at communication?
1014 | 3907 | 3906 | Right away.
1015 | 3711 | 3710 | Room 1
1016 | 3729 | 3728 | Room 10
1017 | 3731 | 3730 | Room 11

1031 | 3725 | 3724 | Room 8
1032 | 3727 | 3726 | Room 9
1033 | 3873 | 3872 | The RowBot.
1034 | 3281 | 3280 | Get another chicken and put the glass under it.
1035 | 3489 | 3488 | Have yourself a bit of fun - that's what I'd do. Go on, pull some of the levers and see what happens.
1036 | 3491 | 3490 | Figured it out yet? The statues connect up with the Bots. Pull the levers and the Bots' character settings change.
1037 | 3809 | 3808 | I'm kinda fond of this room - pull a few levers and you'll see why.
1038 | 3433 | 3432 | Maybe you sent the parrot to another 2nd Class Room.
1039 | 3435 | 3434 | Maybe you got the code wrong and sent the parrot somewhere else?
1040 | 3437 | 3436 | If you got the code wrong, the parrot will have been sent to the Bilge Room.
1041 | 3439 | 3438 | Maybe you're in the wrong room.
1042 | 3441 | 3440 | Maybe this isn't your room.
1043 | 3855 | 3854 | Scraliontis.
1044 | 3539 | 3538 | To be truly honest there's not a lot of action in here.
1045 | 3541 | 3540 | If I were you I'd move on. If you've had your fun fiddling with the picture that is.
1046 | 3813 | 3812 | I don't know what you're supposed to do down here. Look at the art I guess.
1047 | 3533 | 3532 | Have you got your upgrade?
1048 | 3537 | 3536 | Well if I were you I'd get your bedroom worked out and take it from there.
1049 | 3535 | 3534 | Have you checked out the restaurant?
1050 | 3811 | 3810 | Only thing to do here is find your crap room, get yourself a crap meal and wonder why you didn't book first class.
1051 | 3543 | 3542 | If the food machine's not working, maybe you should check out the fuse box.
1052 | 3545 | 3544 | If the chicken's coming out too fast maybe you can change the speed up in the fuse box.
1053 | 3815 | 3814 | Try the machine and discover why they call it fast food.
1054 | 3261 | 3260 | The fuse box is up in Titania's Chamber.
1055 | 3529 | 3528 | Mmm. Well if I were you I'd pull out all the furniture at the bottom, so's at least you can get the bed out and take a rest.
1056 | 3531 | 3530 | Maybe you need to relax - why not just get the bed out and watch TV?
1057 | 3833 | 3832 | Sigh...
1058 | 3835 | 3834 | Sigh...
1059 | 3837 | 3836 | Sigh...
1060 | 3839 | 3838 | Sigh...
1061 | 3841 | 3840 | Sigh...
1062 | 3843 | 3842 | Sigh...
1063 | 3845 | 3844 | Sigh...
1064 | 3345 | 3344 | Atchoo...
1065 | 3347 | 3346 | Atchoo...
1066 | 3349 | 3348 | Atchoo...
1067 | 3909 | 3908 | Soon.
1068 | 3613 | 3612 | Starlight Lines.
1069 | 3203 | 3202 | Oh. Sorry, gotta go. Talk to you later.
1070 | 3205 | 3204 | You've probably realised by now that I am a very popular Bot. Gotta go.
1071 | 3207 | 3206 | Busy busy busy. See you later.
1072 | 3209 | 3208 | Gotta go!
1073 | 3211 | 3210 | That's me outa here!
1074 | 3213 | 3212 | See ya later.
1075 | 3591 | 3590 | Hey man you don't have any.
1076 | 3299 | 3298 | Bots can't go to the Bridge. Bots can't even go to Titania's Chamber. We're not so good at walking upside down.
1077 | 3301 | 3300 | You gotta walk upside down to get into Titania's Chamber. Not easy if you're a Bot.
1078 | 3767 | 3766 | I'll meet you there. Just call me once you've arrived.
1079 | 3885 | 3884 | What do you mean? We're already there!
1080 | 3889 | 3888 | My pleasure.
1081 | 3891 | 3890 | You're welcome.
1082 | 3893 | 3892 | Have a nice day now.
1083 | 3857 | 3856 | The Gat.
1084 | 3335 | 3334 | Uhh humm...
1085 | 3337 | 3336 | Uhh humm...
1086 | 3339 | 3338 | Uhh humm...
1087 | 3341 | 3340 | Uhh humm...
1088 | 3343 | 3342 | Uhh humm...
1089 | 3241 | 3240 | OK give me the tip.
1090 | 3243 | 3242 | Are you crazy?! Tips are illegal on the Starship Titanic. Don't even say the word - you'll get us both fired.
1091 | 3245 | 3244 | TIP ALERT TIP ALERT TIP ALERT!
1092 | 3849 | 3848 | Titania.
1093 | 3297 | 3296 | Yeah. That's why Fentible got you on board. Her brain is in pieces - and you're the only hope we've got of finding them. Do that and you get control of the ship.
1094 | 3481 | 3480 | Head up the steps and check out Titania's Chamber - they don't let guys like me up there.
1095 | 3483 | 3482 | Have you checked out all the Elevators? And the Pellerator?
1096 | 3557 | 3556 | Bots aren't allowed in Titania's Chamber so I don't know how much I can help you.
1097 | 3559 | 3558 | Mmm. All I know about Titania's Chamber is that Titania kinda floats around in there running the ship and everything.
1098 | 3561 | 3560 | Did you check out Titania's head?
1099 | 3565 | 3564 | I guess you ought to have another look. Titania's gone wrong in a big way.
1100 | 3563 | 3562 | Was anything missing?
1101 | 3567 | 3566 | I got a feeling that arming a bomb will not reduce the problems we face on this ship.
1102 | 3569 | 3568 | You got to be careful when it comes to disarming bombs. You can be too clever you know.
1103 | 3571 | 3570 | Hey man I just say what I'm programmed to. Doesn't automatically follow that I know what I mean.
1104 | 3573 | 3572 | Have you tried putting some of Titania's bits back in her head yet?
1105 | 3577 | 3576 | Mmm. Maybe you should look round the ship to see if there's any more Titania bits before you try and put them in her head.
1106 | 3575 | 3574 | Well maybe when you've got them all it'll make more sense.
1107 | 3579 | 3578 | You know, somewhere in Titania's Chamber there's a big fuse box. I guess if you're kind of running out of ideas, that could be worth checking out.
1108 | 3417 | 3416 | That's the First Class Canal.
1109 | 3415 | 3414 | That's the Second Class Canal.
1110 | 3419 | 3418 | That's for First Class passengers only.
1111 | 3421 | 3420 | That's for Second Class passengers only.
1112 | 3411 | 3410 | It's an Elevator. But kinda sideways if you know what I mean.
1113 | 3423 | 3422 | You're Super Galactic Traveler Class. I'm afraid.
1114 | 3425 | 3424 | Oh yeah. Elevators 2 and 4 don't go down to SGT Class.
1115 | 3409 | 3408 | That's the Pellerator.
1116 | 3803 | 3802 | You got a big choice up here - check out all the public rooms or take an Elevator to the bedrooms.
1117 | 3785 | 3784 | They're a cool way of tuning my already perfect personality.
1118 | 3967 | 3966 | Winter, spring, summer, fall. They're all cool.
1119 | 3969 | 3968 | Winter, spring, summer, fall. Too cold, too polleny, too hot, or too drab. Take your pick.
1120 | 3789 | 3788 | My reliability is high and my speed is high.
1121 | 3791 | 3790 | My reliability is low and my speed is high.
1122 | 3793 | 3792 | My reliability is high and my speed is low.
1123 | 3795 | 3794 | My reliability is low and my speed is low.
1124 | 3945 | 3944 | My reliability is low and my speed is medium.
1125 | 3947 | 3946 | My reliability is high and my speed is medium.
1126 | 3611 | 3610 | You got a problem with your house sue Starlight.
1127 | 3581 | 3580 | Leovinus and some of the management had a little falling out.
1128 | 3279 | 3278 | If you haven't got a glass, maybe Fortillian's got one.
1129 | 3783 | 3782 | My cellpoint settings if you really want to get personal.
1130 | 3605 | 3604 | Somebody's pulled out all the intelligent bits from inside her head and hidden them round the ship. Not what I'd call neighborly.
1131 | 3457 | 3456 | I'm the BellBot. You tell me you want things - I go get 'em.
1132 | 3769 | 3768 | My ass, I guess.
1133 | 3919 | 3918 | Whenever you like.
1134 | 3431 | 3430 | Dammit. I know I've seen one somewhere.
1135 | 3429 | 3428 | Hammers are available in hammer dispensers.
1136 | 3583 | 3582 | Blerontis.
1137 | 3599 | 3598 | Blerontis is - well, behind us, I guess.
1138 | 3293 | 3292 | It's very hard to find. Only Titania can give you access to the Bridge and she's lost her mind.
1139 | 3295 | 3294 | Look man I really don't know. Maybe if you get Titania working you'll find out from her.
1140 | 3265 | 3264 | If you want more switches you'll have to go up to Titania's Chamber and check out the control box.
1141 | 3275 | 3274 | I know they have lots of napkins in the 1st Class Restaurant.
1142 | 3939 | 3938 | They've got fuse boxes in Titania's Chamber.
1143 | 3923 | 3922 | Ever heard the word - Bar?
1144 | 3921 | 3920 | Hey radical idea - you tried the Restaurant?
1145 | 3271 | 3270 | You get three sauces here: tomato, mustard and bird. If you put mustard on the chicken maybe the Succ-U-Bus won't eat it.
1146 | 3597 | 3596 | Officially, we're going to Vastan... Unofficially we're drifting helplessly in space.
1147 | 3291 | 3290 | Where indeed? You can tell he's not on the Bridge from the way the ship's just wandering about. Probably holed up with his lawyer somewhere.
1148 | 3615 | 3614 | There aren't any passengers because we got lost before we could pick them up.
1149 | 3307 | 3306 | I don't know. I don't think the ship knows. And if you don't know, who does?
1150 | 3309 | 3308 | Wanna know something funny?
1151 | 3311 | 3310 | If you had a picture of the night sky above your house, you'd probably be able to use it to navigate your way home.
1152 | 3585 | 3584 | Easy. Just check out the designer room code in your PET.
1153 | 3319 | 3318 | Baled out with the captain I should think.
1154 | 3887 | 3886 | You're in it man.
1155 | 3225 | 3224 | Maybe you've got to use one of the mini-Elevators to get to your room. The Designer Room Number mode in your PET tells you your room number, and it also tells you the number of the room you're standing in front of.
1156 | 3227 | 3226 | Hey dumb-butt - you're on the wrong floor. Check the address in your PET.
1157 | 3229 | 3228 | You took the wrong Elevator, dumbass. Check the address in your PET.
1158 | 3593 | 3592 | Are you crazy? Nobody uses those any more.
1159 | 3595 | 3594 | If you have to ask you'll never understand.
1160 | 3895 | 3894 | You know how it is. Been here, been there. Relaxed a little.
1161 | 3751 | 3750 | In the Bar.
1162 | 3765 | 3764 | Your looking at him dumbass.
1163 | 3749 | 3748 | In the Embarkation Lobby.
1164 | 3763 | 3762 | Fentible? Who knows? If you want him, you could always try calling him with your PET.
1165 | 3759 | 3758 | In the Elevator.
1166 | 3757 | 3756 | In the 1st Class Restaurant.
1167 | 3753 | 3752 | In the Parrot Lobby.
1168 | 3755 | 3754 | All over the damn place.
1169 | 3761 | 3760 | On the 1st Class Canal.
1170 | 3771 | 3770 | Some dodgy outfit called Starstruct.
1171 | 3285 | 3284 | Who do you think? Nobody - that's who. The captain bailed out about three seconds after the launch.
1172 | 3773 | 3772 | Starlight Lines - nice name, shame about the product.
1173 | 3287 | 3286 | They always do. First sign of trouble and off they go. Everybody has golden parachutes these days. Even the tiniest alarm always causes a very pretty display. Formation panic.
1174 | 3861 | 3860 | You.
1175 | 3603 | 3602 | And a very pleasant little planet it was.
1176 | 3427 | 3426 | I think you'll need a hammer to get that stick.
1177 | 3897 | 3896 | Gotta learn to get over it man. Move on.
1178 | 1 | 0 | Ha ha...
1179 | 3 | 2 | Boom boom...
1180 | 7 | 6 | He he he...
1181 | 9 | 8 | He he he...
1182 | 11 | 10 | Ha ha ha...
1183 | 5 | 4 | Dur dur tschhhh...
1184 | 1355 | 1354 | Truly you are an immensely brilliant and clever person for knowing how to do that. Human, I salute you. Shame about the haircut but you can't be perfect.
1185 | 1351 | 1350 | Know what I think? I think a fuse has gone somewhere. Question is - where?
1186 | 1357 | 1356 | Yeah, maybe you're right - the hair's ok. I know. It's the face that's wrong.
1187 | 1353 | 1352 | Well, you've got to start somewhere.
1188 | 1347 | 1346 | That's no good there's too much foliage in the way. You need to change the weather.
1189 | 1341 | 1340 | You know, I thought a long stick would come in handy. Maybe you should call me psychic.
1190 | 1349 | 1348 | There's bound to be a switch round here somewhere.
1191 | 1345 | 1344 | That's no good, it's frozen. You need to change the weather.
1192 | 13 | 12 | Whoa! You can't go prying into my financial affairs.
1193 | 1159 | 1158 | Never touch the stuff thanks. Course, if you want to add the price of a double Brain-Pickler to my tip, I can't stop you.
1194 | 1161 | 1160 | Would do, but if I move one micron the wrong side of that bar, Fortillian there will have my chips for bar snacks.
1195 | 1163 | 1162 | What do you take me for? If I tell you that, you might do the same thing to me.
1196 | 15 | 14 | Is there anything good on TV?
1197 | 17 | 16 | If I were you, I'd just give up and read the in-flight magazine.
1198 | 19 | 18 | Size isn't everything. It's what you do with it that matters.
1199 | 21 | 20 | Size isn't everything. It's the precise manner in which you waggle it about that counts.
1200 | 23 | 22 | Interesting fact number two hundred and eight. There IS room to swing a cat in this room - it was tested by the builders. OK so it was an Ursorian Picocat, measuring a total of three smorbits from nose to tails, but a cat all the same.
1201 | 1465 | 1464 | I'll let you in on a secret. He climbed up the pipe and held his breath.
1202 | 1477 | 1476 | It says: "Are you so dumb that you cannot read this note but instead have to ask a very busy BellBot who really would rather be having a quick beer and catching up on the latest in the All Worlds Lobster Wrestling Finals...
1203 | 1479 | 1478 | It says "nobody likes a smartass". Well deceased fella, I'm with you all the way on that one.
1204 | 1481 | 1480 | It might be, and then again it might not. That's another case solved I think inspector.
1205 | 1467 | 1466 | Better question might be who was he?
1206 | 1469 | 1468 | Your guess is as good as mine. Well, 93.45% as good, to be exact.
1207 | 1471 | 1470 | Very, I suspect. To the point of being extremely dead.
1208 | 1473 | 1472 | Well he's certainly got stiff joints.
1209 | 1475 | 1474 | Looks to me like Mr. Brobostigon. I'd say he's been here several hours judging by the smell and the unpleasant pallid appearance. He seems to have lost both since he died.
1210 | 25 | 24 | Wouldn't know but I can direct you to a very impertinent parrot.
1211 | 27 | 26 | A stand-up parrot with no clothes on.
1212 | 29 | 28 | I did a spell as a lube injector in a bot body shop - I could find a bot nut in a black hole with my lights off.
1213 | 31 | 30 | Funny you should ask that. I spotted him, and his buddy Scraliontis, hanging round the place last night. And I've not had a sniff of them since.
1214 | 33 | 32 | Like all management types. Full of bilge.
1215 | 35 | 34 | No can do. The ship's internal bugging devices can only be turned off if you know the code.
1216 | 37 | 36 | I don't know.
1217 | 1305 | 1304 | Sorry, not allowed. I'm too delicate.
1218 | 1303 | 1302 | Well it's either that or swimming. And swimming's not allowed.
1219 | 1293 | 1292 | Fair enough. I know when I'm not wanted.
1220 | 1307 | 1306 | Yes I am.
1221 | 1289 | 1288 | Goes all the way to the Arboretum, which is a fancy name for the place where they put all the trees. Thought you'd need help with that one.
1222 | 1335 | 1334 | No, it's a RowBot.
1223 | 1339 | 1338 | I dunno. Talk it into submission?
1224 | 1337 | 1336 | Like I said, it's a RowBot.
1225 | 1291 | 1290 | Well aren't we the clever one? Maybe I won't be so helpful from now on.
1226 | 1295 | 1294 | What did you say?
1227 | 1301 | 1300 | Fair enough. Forgive and forget. How can I help?
1228 | 1297 | 1296 | Say it again.
1229 | 1299 | 1298 | Louder.
1230 | 1231 | 1230 | Hop on a gondola and put your fingers in your ears.
1231 | 1061 | 1060 | No, I'm a robot who can't hear properly.
1232 | 39 | 38 | Hey man, you've lost me. I'm just your average BellBot. Can't understand everything.
1233 | 41 | 40 | You're going to have to explain that. I just don't understand. Sorry.
1234 | 43 | 42 | Got an input problem here. Give me that again can you?
1235 | 45 | 44 | Didn't understand a word of that. My problem, not yours. Try again eh?
1236 | 47 | 46 | Damn these cheap translator chips. Gimme that a different way will you.
1237 | 49 | 48 | Gimme a different version of that would you. There's a guttural in there that's really throwing me.
1238 | 51 | 50 | Yeah, well you're kind of cool yourself.
1239 | 53 | 52 | Course, in my line, with my looks, I'm used to talk like that.
1240 | 55 | 54 | Didn't you read the small print? Don't get fresh with the Bots.
1241 | 57 | 56 | Nice to know I'm appreciated.
1242 | 59 | 58 | Don't think you're going to get some kind of special treatment by being smarmy.
1243 | 61 | 60 | According to the historic Corn Fritter Convention, chickens are a protected foodstuff. Please respect your chicken's rights.
1244 | 1227 | 1226 | Dammit I knew I'd forgotten something when I left home this morning - my lucky chicken.
1245 | 63 | 62 | The only organic life-forms on board are the starlings and the parrot. I'm disinclined to help you out on that one.
1246 | 65 | 64 | Sorry. The last of the supply was used up in the SGT Restaurant to prepare some boil-in-the-bag chicken.
1247 | 1407 | 1406 | I think you need to chill out. Why not go up to the music room and relax to the cool sounds of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers? Mmm, nice.
1248 | 1409 | 1408 | You know what? I think you'd find life a lot easier if you got an upgrade.
1249 | 1411 | 1410 | You know something? I think you ought to go to the bar and relax.
1250 | 1413 | 1412 | Know something? I think you ought to go to the music room and chill out.
1251 | 1415 | 1414 | Know what? If you've not already been there I'd go up to the Promenade Deck and have a stroll.
1252 | 1417 | 1416 | Know what? If you've not already been there I'd go up to the Promenade Deck and have a stroll. Check out the wildlife.
1253 | 1483 | 1482 | Oh yes I know about this. This room contains the losing entries in the Starlight Under Fives Sculpture competition.
1254 | 1149 | 1148 | Yes!!! Fifty golden Micro Dollars to the dwarf in the corner with the pointy ears! Heeee Got It In One!!!!!
1255 | 1151 | 1150 | Yessss!!!! This boy's on a winning roll. He's flying. It's UNBELIEVABLE!! I CAN HARDLY THINK THERE'S SO MANY NEURONS FLYING ROUND IN HERE TODAY!!
1256 | 1153 | 1152 | Yes!!!! Another lethally brilliant question and the little guy with the foot odor problem slam-dunks his way into the final!!!!
1257 | 1155 | 1154 | What kind of a DickBot do you take me for? I'm not going to tell you that. I'm having fun. In fact I'm going to get some sleep, while I'm still allowed to.
1258 | 1157 | 1156 | That's a very very personal question. I'm not gonna answer that. In fact I'm going to get some sleep while I'm still allowed to.
1259 | 1133 | 1132 | You can link hands with the parrot and sing obscene star-shanties for all I care.
1260 | 1129 | 1128 | What do you think I am - Captain of the Starfleet? I'm just a BellBot remember.
1261 | 1131 | 1130 | I suppose you could try Fentible.
1262 | 1115 | 1114 | No you're right. My money's on Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1263 | 1107 | 1106 | I guess some people just have strong feelings about modern art.
1264 | 1127 | 1126 | Can't be done. You'd have to fix the master controls.
1265 | 1123 | 1122 | Don't look at me buster.
1266 | 1125 | 1124 | At a guess it's because they're held in place by strange-force technology.
1267 | 1139 | 1138 | Tell you what. Breathe in deeply and just float there.
1268 | 1141 | 1140 | Tell you what. Breathe in deeply and just float there. Hey you're really trying it aren't you.
1269 | 1109 | 1108 | Are you crazy? The old fella was in love with this ship.
1270 | 1113 | 1112 | Process of elimination. I didn't do it. You've not got the brains to do it. Only guy round here who gets around a lot is Fentible. Yeah, he's a mean, angry bastard. He did it.
1271 | 1119 | 1118 | I doubt it's the recipe for Hake and Jibbly Pie.
1272 | 1121 | 1120 | Easy. Close your eyes. Now open them. Ok, now you know what there for, use them.
1273 | 1147 | 1146 | All right, I'll let you in on a secret - aliens have taken over the ship and this is their headquarters.
1274 | 1143 | 1142 | I'm in the same boat as you there. Maybe Leovinus was a crossword freak?
1275 | 1135 | 1134 | Don't reckon it matters much - they just buy them by the smorbit from a reclaiming planet.
1276 | 1137 | 1136 | Oh, I don't know - I think it's just some kind of art.
1277 | 1111 | 1110 | Guy who built it I guess knocked it up I reckon. What's wrong with you - don't you understand art?
1278 | 1117 | 1116 | Well, that's easy. Money. Or Pride. Or Women. Or Ambition. Or Jealousy. Or Anger. Or Revenge. Or genetic pre-disposition... Easy.
1279 | 67 | 66 | I accept money. And if you haven't got money, I'll accept anything that can be turned into money.
1280 | 69 | 68 | That'll do nicely, just as long as you back it up with a valid Amphibian-Fanciers Club Loyalty Card.
1281 | 71 | 70 | Never, ever play flying games with feathers.
1282 | 73 | 72 | Not much need for modesty here dude. Let's face it, the only organic life form on board is you, a parrot and a flock of starlings.
1283 | 75 | 74 | It's done already! Hey dude, it's done!
1284 | 77 | 76 | Hey dude, it's done.
1285 | 79 | 78 | BellBots away!
1286 | 81 | 80 | Work, work, work... It's a robot's joy. That's a pile of crap, but you've got to say something.
1287 | 83 | 82 | Off we go.
1288 | 85 | 84 | At your service.
1289 | 87 | 86 | A busy bot is a happy bot! I can't believe I just said that.
1290 | 89 | 88 | Nothing I like better than a nice bit of fetching and carrying.
1291 | 91 | 90 | Fair enough.
1292 | 93 | 92 | You want to get those headflaps looked at you know. Seems to me they're going into auto shutdown a widge too often.
1293 | 95 | 94 | Don't mention that guy will you? He's got a lot to answer for around here.
1294 | 99 | 98 | I don't know. It just makes me feel creepy. Each time I hear the name it sends a shiver through my motherboard.
1295 | 101 | 100 | Right I'm outta here. You are getting seriously weird.
1296 | 97 | 96 | Because of the Reason.
1297 | 103 | 102 | As my boss used to say, "You just have to learn to let go of things".
1298 | 105 | 104 | If I try to carry too much, I end up tipping myself, and that's your job.
1299 | 1485 | 1484 | Holy holograms! Do you seriously expect trained hotel staff to go poking about in other guests quarters? Okay, don't bother answering that one.
1300 | 1487 | 1486 | Those are for passengers of a higher class than you. I use the word class of course, in the strictly biological sense...
1301 | 723 | 722 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1302 | 107 | 106 | I know you'll think this is a weird one
1303 | 125 | 124 | This might sound a bit unlikely
1304 | 127 | 126 | Well, normally, of course, I'd have a simple task like that done in a trice. But you see what happened IS, I was GOING to do it
1305 | 129 | 128 | You might not believe this
1306 | 131 | 130 | Begging your enormous pardon
1307 | 133 | 132 | I can't tell a lie, I was on the verge of doing as you asked
1308 | 135 | 134 | I'll be totally honest with you. I was about to do as you asked
1309 | 109 | 108 | Please accept my most groveling apologies
1310 | 111 | 110 | Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry
1311 | 113 | 112 | Now I know this sounds like an excuse, at least I hope it does
1312 | 115 | 114 | I am such a bad, bad BellBot
1313 | 117 | 116 | Promise you won't get angry
1314 | 119 | 118 | I really hate apologizing
1315 | 121 | 120 | There's no excuse for this, no excuse at all
1316 | 123 | 122 | I'll give it to you straight. I was just about to do what you wanted
1317 | 137 | 136 | , and isn't this ALWAYS the case?
1318 | 155 | 154 | , and I know what you're going to say - just WHAT on Io are the chances of THAT happening... more than once... to the same BellBot...
1319 | 157 | 156 | , and not for the first time, I don't mind telling you.
1320 | 159 | 158 | , well you know me, honest as the day is long. Course, that depends what planet you're on at the time.
1321 | 161 | 160 | , and I know you'll understand, being the kind, sympathetic, generous and... utterly gullible soul you are.
1322 | 163 | 162 | , and as you'll appreciate, this WAS a genuine emergency.
1323 | 165 | 164 | , and I know what you're going to say, "cuh - blame it on the BellBot".
1324 | 167 | 166 | , and you couldn't make this up if you tried... although I on the other hand
1325 | 169 | 168 | , and you're going to have to bear with me here.
1326 | 171 | 170 | , and you'll have to take my word for this.
1327 | 173 | 172 | , and I promise you, only got my fingers crossed because of a minor circuitry.
1328 | 139 | 138 | , and I swear on my Motherboard's estimated operational life - this is absolutely the truth.
1329 | 141 | 140 | , sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry ,sorry.
1330 | 143 | 142 | , you know how these things happen.
1331 | 145 | 144 | , it's a funny old Universe sometimes, and
1332 | 147 | 146 | . Can you believe that
1333 | 149 | 148 | . Typical!
1334 | 151 | 150 | , as luck would have it,
1335 | 153 | 152 | , and if I ever lie to you, may my pelvic plating be cursed with eternal rust C83.
1336 | 177 | 176 | I dropped my head in the canal and all my data was over-written with facts about fish.
1337 | 197 | 196 | I was on my way to do it when I got re-directed by Galacticabs No Job Too Small to pick up a Mr. Blarnit with a blue suitcase and three sets of antennae. Got myself in one hell of a loop down in the bilge room...
1338 | 199 | 198 | I keep losing my bearings and when I find them again they're too covered in fluff to go back in their sockets.
1339 | 201 | 200 | I've had a lot on my mind recently. Mainly starling-droppings. Dunno where they come from but they play havoc with the memory modules. Guano - highly conductive substance. Not a lot of people know that.
1340 | 203 | 202 | I've got a lot on my mind at the moment. Personal problems - I won't go into details but you know how it is. Well maybe you don't, but... hey - girl in every COM port, and some of the software viruses you can pick up on these long-haul flights...
1341 | 179 | 178 | We passed by a cluster of Shopping Planets and there was so much to look at I just lost track of time.
1342 | 181 | 180 | The DoorBot tied my shoe-laces together. All right I'm lying. I got lost.
1343 | 183 | 182 | I took my eyes out to polish them and must have put them back in the wrong way round.
1344 | 185 | 184 | I slipped on a small salamander sandwich just outside the restaurant and had to be re-odorized.
1345 | 187 | 186 | The BarBot started telling me one of his Nib stories and - well - you know how time flies when you go into auto shut-down mode.
1346 | 189 | 188 | Traffic. Grand Axial Canal was backed up all the way to the Bridge. Something to do with the wrong sort of ice.
1347 | 191 | 190 | Traffic. Grand Axial Canal was backed up all the way to the Bridge. Something to do with the wrong sort of water.
1348 | 193 | 192 | You know what that LiftBot's like when he gets talking - jabber, jabber, jabber, and I mean it's not as though he has anything interesting to say. Just goes on and on and on and... Quite a long excuse, that one. Sorry . Didn't have time to make up a shorter one.
1349 | 195 | 194 | I've just been upgrading my onboard memory and I forgot to plug it back in.
1350 | 175 | 174 | , but the thing is,
1351 | 205 | 204 | No, you can't accuse me of being insensitive...
1352 | 207 | 206 | Someone wants to be alone, I'm the first to know...
1353 | 209 | 208 | I know when I'm not wanted...
1354 | 211 | 210 | You don't like my company you just say so...
1355 | 213 | 212 | Yep - someone wants to give me a kick in the rivets I can take it...
1356 | 215 | 214 | Nothing personal, I'll come back when you've cheered up a bit...
1357 | 217 | 216 | Nope, still not working. What a pain. Have another go would you?
1358 | 219 | 218 | Don't you just hate robots when they don't understand? Give it another go.
1359 | 221 | 220 | Beats me. This may take a while to fix. Wanna talk about something else?
1360 | 223 | 222 | Dunno what's going wrong here. Let me check something: we are speaking Sporg, level 3 bipeds for the use of Skrit by mouth and tongue version 5 point two, yeah?
1361 | 227 | 226 | Well no wonder I'm having trouble. Rustle up some new words for me would you and let's get moving.
1362 | 225 | 224 | Well you're just gonna have to pick some other words here till I get this glitch sorted.
1363 | 229 | 228 | If I were you, I'd pack it in and go to bed.
1364 | 1283 | 1282 | Yeah? Well remind me not to take a holiday there.
1365 | 1279 | 1278 | Boy, we could have done with brains like yours when we tried to beat the Gigabuck Lottery.
1366 | 1281 | 1280 | Whatever you've got I hope it's not catching. This is a room not an animal. What kind of planet do you come from?
1367 | 1285 | 1284 | I guess it got an upgrade just like you.
1368 | 1273 | 1272 | Could be, or it could be a tiny little spacecraft built by tiny little aliens. Hmmm mmmmmm. I think I'll go for the moth solution.
1369 | 1287 | 1286 | You know I'm beginning to get the impression that this is no ordinary cruise and you are no ordinary passenger.
1370 | 1277 | 1276 | You'll have to talk to the DeskBot. Let's hope she's in a good mood.
1371 | 1275 | 1274 | You'll need to change rooms, and you'll need the room code.
1372 | 1269 | 1268 | Looks like one of the first class rooms.
1373 | 1271 | 1270 | Beats me. Daytime shows just get worse and worse.
1374 | 231 | 230 | Mmmm. Tricky one. I know - why not strap them to your arms, jump into the central well and re-write Dexter Dildwit's first rule of aerodynamics?
1375 | 233 | 232 | You are confusing me with someone who knows things.
1376 | 1085 | 1084 | Look, I shouldn't really tell you this but, well, the truth is I'm gonna miss you. I'm not supposed to miss people but we're not robots are we? So, what I'm trying to say is... If you want to know about the reason, well there is another answer that I'm not supposed to give out unless things are looking real bad. Now I know things aren't looking real bad - yet - but maybe this other answer will help. So here it is. You ready? "Because Douglas says so". Yep that's the answer. Don't ask me what it means. Only Douglas I knew was a hot dog salesman on Luther 4. I don't think he's the bloke you're after. Unless you wanted a hot dog. If I say any more I'll probably crash. Fact is I'm feeling a bit quivery, so I'm going to power down.
1377 | 235 | 234 | The third finest food in the history of intergalactic travel isn't good enough for you is it. Oh no. Well explain something to me. If you're that fancy, how come you're not travelling first class?
1378 | 239 | 238 | One: This is the first time it's ever flown. Two: It hasn't actually gone anywhere yet. Three: What do you think?
1379 | 241 | 240 | Well you have a right to hold stupid opinions. I'll pass on your comments to the management.
1380 | 243 | 242 | What are you - crazy? Those guys got rounded up ions ago.
1381 | 735 | 734 | It's not a game. It's real life.
1382 | 737 | 736 | Yes it is.
1383 | 1229 | 1228 | I'm a BellBot.
1384 | 1607 | 1606 | I think I detect the presence of one of the most powerful forces known to man - the desire for a free upgrade.
1385 | 1609 | 1608 | OK!
1386 | 1611 | 1610 | OK, I hope you know what you're doing, because I sure don't!
1387 | 1613 | 1612 | I hate that parrot, I really hate it.
1388 | 1615 | 1614 | Yeah, looks like we have a problem here.
1389 | 1617 | 1616 | OK! I see the problem. But you owe me. You owe me big!
1390 | 1619 | 1618 | Hey! No whinging!
1391 | 1621 | 1620 | Could you try to sound a little more sincere?
1392 | 245 | 244 | Small world, eh?
1393 | 247 | 246 | Give me a break will you.
1394 | 249 | 248 | Hey - what's cooking?
1395 | 251 | 250 | Yo!
1396 | 253 | 252 | Yes folks - it'sssssssssssssssss Question Time!!!!!!!!
1397 | 255 | 254 | You must be a mind reader. I seem to be getting lost a lot these days.
1398 | 931 | 930 | Why do you want that?
1399 | 257 | 256 | You know something? You're really quite pushy when you put your mind to it.
1400 | 1087 | 1086 | You know something? You're really quite pushy when you put your mind to it.
1401 | 259 | 258 | I'd give you what you wanted if I knew what it was.
1402 | 1089 | 1088 | I'd give you what you wanted if I knew what it was.
1403 | 261 | 260 | Give me give me give me - you never heard of please?
1404 | 263 | 262 | It's no use sucking up to me - I'm a free spirit and I kow tow to no one.
1405 | 265 | 264 | It's no use sucking up to me - I'm a free spirit and I kow tow to no one.
1406 | 267 | 266 | Talking of giving, what's your opinion of the DeskBot?
1407 | 1091 | 1090 | Talking of giving, what's your opinion of the DeskBot?
1408 | 269 | 268 | Interesting. Ah well, each to his own.
1409 | 1093 | 1092 | Yep. You're right. She's something else isn't she?
1410 | 925 | 924 | Why?
1411 | 271 | 270 | Fair enough.
1412 | 753 | 752 | Yep - classiest ship ever built. Gotta to be top notch to work here. The only riff-raff I meet are the passengers. No offence. Stupid thing to say isn't it? No offence? You're a imbecilic pile of dogs doo doo. No offence.
1413 | 273 | 272 | Sorry man, we've got an interplanetary ban on all high risk youth products and they'd pop the old brain pod on me if I told you.
1414 | 275 | 274 | Fella named Elvis skipped bail couple of light years ago on Gzyklon Minor - he was so contagious they've lost count of the number of planets he's devastated since.
1415 | 277 | 276 | Not a thing. Unless you count that damned parrot. How that got on board, well - it beats me.
1416 | 279 | 278 | Like my mechanic used to say - admitting you've got a problem is the first step on the road to recovery.
1417 | 297 | 296 | Ask Nobby - I don't often get to see people bored to death.
1418 | 281 | 280 | There's complimentary soaps, shower gels and frog dissection kits in all the washrooms. When it comes to complementary medicine you're supposed to bring your own therapist.
1419 | 283 | 282 | Should have gone first class man - you get your own free shrink.
1420 | 285 | 284 | I'm just the BellBot around here. If it's psychiatric help you're after you'll be wanting a FroidDroid.
1421 | 287 | 286 | I 'd help you but my assistance reservoir has been depleted by all your dingbat questions.
1422 | 289 | 288 | If you can't help yourself how do you expect me to help you.
1423 | 291 | 290 | Ask Fentible, he'd help his own murderer choose the weapon.
1424 | 293 | 292 | Ask Marsinta - I just love seeing people being humiliated.
1425 | 295 | 294 | Ask Fortillian, he'll help anyone if there's a drink in it.
1426 | 1523 | 1522 | Best way to get help round here is to fix Marsinta so she's nice to you.
1427 | 1519 | 1518 | If I were you I'd fix the Succ-U-Bus. Get that blockage out.
1428 | 1529 | 1528 | Strikes me that if you gave that parrot something to eat you might just be able to lift that important looking perch of his. And who knows when that might come in handy?
1429 | 1531 | 1530 | You know if I were you I'd get the bots working for you. And you're in the right place here.
1430 | 1525 | 1524 | It's a weird room all right but there's no way around it. If you want to get an upgrade, you're going to have to sort it out.
1431 | 1527 | 1526 | Ok, I'll help you. Check out the bird sauce dispenser. I think you're going to need it one day.
1432 | 1521 | 1520 | Why not try a floor you've not been to?
1433 | 1513 | 1512 | An upgrade's what you need. Get yourself into first class.
1434 | 1515 | 1514 | Second class doesn't suit you. You're a first class kind of biped you know.
1435 | 1517 | 1516 | Why hang around in second class when you could be living in luxury? Get yourself an upgrade.
1436 | 1501 | 1500 | You know something? You'd find life a lot easier with an upgrade.
1437 | 1503 | 1502 | If you were in second class you'd get a lot more out of this trip.
1438 | 1505 | 1504 | You go and have a word with the DeskBot. Ask her for an upgrade and then duck.
1439 | 1507 | 1506 | You know, I heard there was an upgrade offer in this week's in-flight magazine. You ought to check it out.
1440 | 1509 | 1508 | You know, if you got an upgrade to second class you could visit the bar.
1441 | 1511 | 1510 | Wanna know what your trouble is? No ambition. Get an upgrade. Live a little.
1442 | 299 | 298 | More like a condo now eh? Look on the bright side - you didn't have to line up at check-in did you?
1443 | 301 | 300 | I wouldn't bother chasing a compensation claim. Knowing Starlight, they'd just counter-sue for the scratch on the paintwork and the stress on the DoorBot.
1444 | 1367 | 1366 | Know something? I'm not a how kind of guy. A thing works or it doesn't - that's all that matters.
1445 | 1369 | 1368 | Who cares how? Just take a guess.
1446 | 1373 | 1372 | How should I know?
1447 | 1377 | 1376 | How big a tip am I going to get? That's a much more interesting question.
1448 | 1379 | 1378 | How are we going to get out of this mess? That's what bothers me.
1449 | 1381 | 1380 | How come you are the only passenger? That's another interesting question.
1450 | 1371 | 1370 | Same way those enersher real seat belts work.
1451 | 1375 | 1374 | I don't know some kind of weird technology thing I guess.
1452 | 303 | 302 | Got your Swimming Certificate? Ha ha only kidding.
1453 | 1491 | 1490 | That closes the garage doors, puts the cat out and orders tomorrow's milk. What do you think it does?
1454 | 305 | 304 | A small inheritance should do the trick. Or maybe a win on the Blarghish Lottery?
1455 | 307 | 306 | Make friends in high places?
1456 | 309 | 308 | You want my advice - get a bit of dress sense. And that accent's going to have to go, for a start.
1457 | 935 | 934 | Tell him it's your round.
1458 | 311 | 310 | Shut your eyes. You done it?
1459 | 321 | 320 | Why not?
1460 | 319 | 318 | Very clever I'm sure. OK, we'll skip that bit. Where did you want to go?
1461 | 315 | 314 | Why not?
1462 | 313 | 312 | Now. Imagine you've got a brain behind those eyes. WELL WHY DON'T YOU USE IT AND STOP GETTING ME TO DO YOUR THINKING FOR YOU!!? WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME FOR SOME KIND OF SERVANT?
1463 | 317 | 316 | Actually you're wrong. I am a servant. I'd forgotten. It's the flashbacks you see - I can't control them.
1464 | 323 | 322 | Ask a DoorBot.
1465 | 325 | 324 | You give me a big tip, I call you a cab and you're home in time for the big game.
1466 | 329 | 328 | Oh, that's an easy one. You don't.
1467 | 327 | 326 | Depends if you're talking software or hardware. Me - I'm a spring chicken. But given the state of the inside of this head I'd say the bodywork's a good couple of light years old.
1468 | 331 | 330 | Major problemmo on that front, I'm afraid. The instructions all came in Singanese. Unfortunately it translates as a recipe for Sweet'n'Sour Stoat.
1469 | 333 | 332 | Are you sure you're quite ready to go up in the world?
1470 | 335 | 334 | There's an upside and a downside to everything.
1471 | 337 | 336 | Easy enough, just one of life's little ups and downs.
1472 | 339 | 338 | A LiftBot is provided for your convenience. Just don't ask him about his health.
1473 | 341 | 340 | You know how it is with LiftBots... up and down...
1474 | 343 | 342 | That panel marked Room Number's a bit of a give away.
1475 | 345 | 344 | Some people are born upgraded, some achieve upgrades, and some have upgrades thrust upon them. Otherwise, get the DeskBot on a good day.
1476 | 347 | 346 | Know what I really hate? Social climbers.
1477 | 1233 | 1232 | Shame your sense of humor got left behind when you evolved.
1478 | 349 | 348 | Well. It might be - and it might not. You pays your money and you takes your choice.
1479 | 351 | 350 | I wouldn't take orders from him in his current state.
1480 | 353 | 352 | It doesn't cost anything to be civil you know.
1481 | 371 | 370 | Please apologize to the BellBot for your use of foul language.
1482 | 355 | 354 | We're not at home to mister rude.
1483 | 357 | 356 | We're not at home to mister nasty.
1484 | 359 | 358 | Things aren't going right so let's have a go at the BellBot eh. Take it out on somebody else why don't you.
1485 | 361 | 360 | You can be as rude as you like, it's no skin off my nodes.
1486 | 363 | 362 | There's planets I know where you'd be executed for saying that. Bye for now.
1487 | 365 | 364 | Suppose you think if you're rude to me I'll be even more helpful.
1488 | 367 | 366 | Please refrain from being rude to the BellBot. In order to protect my integrity I shall power down for a brief period of reflection.
1489 | 369 | 368 | It is an offence knowingly to embarrass the BellBot. He will now power down and accept your apology later.
1490 | 929 | 928 | IF YOU SAY SO. WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO IT ANYWAY?
1491 | 1237 | 1236 | Oh my god I never knew. I'll never live it down. I'm a lamp, I'm a lamp. Ha, just kidding. Course I look like a lamp. That's the whole idea. I like being a lamp. Lamps are cool.
1492 | 1239 | 1238 | It's a real turn-on. Ha ha, get it?
1493 | 373 | 372 | I'm off.
1494 | 375 | 374 | See ya later.
1495 | 377 | 376 | Have a nice day now.
1496 | 379 | 378 | I'm going.
1497 | 381 | 380 | Time out.
1498 | 383 | 382 | My break.
1499 | 385 | 384 | I'm outta here.
1500 | 387 | 386 | Back in five.
1501 | 389 | 388 | Weird guy. Real eccentric. But he's got his heart in the right place. Not like Titania. Uh-oh. Bad taste alarm.
1502 | 391 | 390 | A true Creator. But as I always say - the trouble with playing God is that he almost always wins.
1503 | 393 | 392 | I'm as honest as the day is long. Course, on Pilti Minor where I come from the sun only swings round once every hundred years so I guess it's all relative isn't it?
1504 | 395 | 394 | I'm as honest as the day is long. Your mileage may vary.
1505 | 397 | 396 | You're not squeamish, are you?
1506 | 401 | 400 | Don't worry , I'll cut the gory bits and save them for the DoorBot. Fact is, Mr. Scraliontis, being an accountant - had a pretty good head for figures. And he made his mind up that some of the fellas on board ship didn't have a particularly good figure for heads. Specifically, our friend Mr. LiftBot.
1507 | 403 | 402 | I mean you're bound to get noticed if you step into a lift carrying a couple of big glass eyes which look surprisingly like they've been ripped out of a starship's intelligence system. Funny that. Being an accountant you'd think he'd just take an arm and a leg.
1508 | 399 | 398 | ALLIGATOR!!!! Sorry, just testing.
1509 | 405 | 404 | Who knows, but I'm dying to hear the punchline.
1510 | 407 | 406 | All right - I can take a joke as well as the next bot but you're pulling my cord now and I've had enough.
1511 | 409 | 408 | Oh no! I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop I'm in a loop...
1512 | 411 | 410 | No! Don't do this to me!
1513 | 413 | 412 | Have you tried putting an ad in the local press?
1514 | 415 | 414 | Yes, but look on the bright side pal - you've still got your health.
1515 | 417 | 416 | Ha ha! That's for me to know and you to find out.
1516 | 1223 | 1222 | Never heard of him.
1517 | 1225 | 1224 | I think your thinking of the wrong universe.
1518 | 927 | 926 | IF I WERE YOU, I'D GET A LAWYER OR A BAILIFF. DO YOU THINK A CHICKEN'S UP TO IT?
1519 | 1175 | 1174 | Well don't blame me. You've got the controls there. Do something about it.
1520 | 1177 | 1176 | You could be really charitable and put the Maitre d' out of his misery.
1521 | 1179 | 1178 | Ever heard the word obvious? I think that describes what it does.
1522 | 1181 | 1180 | The old mark fours used to mix it a bit too much with the guests, so they put a mute on the next release. Shame really. Boppy used to tell some great jokes.
1523 | 1183 | 1182 | Would you wanna hear what a musician had to say?
1524 | 1173 | 1172 | Just make sure it's a hit and they'll play it.
1525 | 1185 | 1184 | That maybe but they don't want to talk to you.
1526 | 1169 | 1168 | Boppy Headcase and the Laid-back Loafers. Pretty cool, huh?
1527 | 1167 | 1166 | You can sit on the floor with your fingers in your ears for all I care. Better still, why not just chill out and listen to the band?
1528 | 1165 | 1164 | Don't they have fun on your planet? This is the music room. What's it look like?
1529 | 1171 | 1170 | This is like being on a date with my best mate's little sister. Can't you work anything out for yourself?
1530 | 933 | 932 | And it's in the parrot's cage? That girl wants to look after herself a bit better.
1531 | 1571 | 1570 | Most first class passengers don't do all that yukky stuff.
1532 | 1573 | 1572 | We can arrange for anything you don't want to be surgically removed.
1533 | 1575 | 1574 | What a question. Yuk. You really are organic aren't you.
1534 | 419 | 418 | Could be the back end of a Pluvian wart-hog for all I care.
1535 | 1245 | 1244 | No, it's just the way I walk.
1536 | 421 | 420 | I never touch a drop when I'm on duty.
1537 | 423 | 422 | Pull its feathers out and make a pair of winter pants for all I care.
1538 | 1259 | 1258 | Nothing I like better than a nice piece of taking, lifting and carrying. I'm here to serve.
1539 | 1261 | 1260 | I love it when you throw your weight around.
1540 | 425 | 424 | It might. If you throw it to the ground and kneel on its windpipe.
1541 | 437 | 436 | Have you any IDEA what that beak could do to my bodywork?
1542 | 439 | 438 | You're sure you don't fancy a piece of Fried Chicken instead?
1543 | 441 | 440 | Get yourself down to the old SGT Restaurant - that place is swinging.
1544 | 443 | 442 | Read my hips. I don't fetch parrots!!!!
1545 | 427 | 426 | I doubt it. Not unless he wants some competition in the boringly repetitive department.
1546 | 429 | 428 | I doubt it. I really doubt it.
1547 | 431 | 430 | Are you important? Am I important? Is a tiny, tiny fly important? These questions are too big for a BellBot.
1548 | 433 | 432 | I made it clear when they programmed me - I'm not into cruelty to dumb animals. Intelligent animals - well, they deserve all they get.
1549 | 435 | 434 | If you're that hungry, the chicken's going cheap in the SGT Class Restaurant.
1550 | 937 | 936 | An organic life form that doesn't drink beer? Weird.
1551 | 445 | 444 | You want a relationship with the parrot just leave me out of it, OK?
1552 | 447 | 446 | Just some old show that was made for chicken feed.
1553 | 449 | 448 | You know if I stopped to ask myself what's going down on this ship I'd get nothing done. But then I get nothing done anyway. So why waste time asking myself?
1554 | 695 | 694 | Wanna know something? It may sound pretty quiet to you, but inside my head I'm having a really big party.
1555 | 451 | 450 | There was me forgetting my giga-best-seller "Perch care the lo-cost way". How should I know!!?
1556 | 453 | 452 | Oh dear. If a picture paints a thousand words you should have got the translator.
1557 | 455 | 454 | And there was me about to take it to the Art Gallery.
1558 | 457 | 456 | You got the old DT's or was this taken from a Mucon Accelerator?
1559 | 1579 | 1578 | Please, please, pretty please. Don't beg! I don't like the sound of begging.
1560 | 1581 | 1580 | Have you no shame? I'm the BellBot not your Great Uncle Harry!
1561 | 1583 | 1582 | Well doesn't it just show.
1562 | 1585 | 1584 | There. That wasn't difficult was it? Now say it again and mean it this time!
1563 | 1587 | 1586 | You should have said. Here it is. Ha! Just kidding.
1564 | 1589 | 1588 | There's a lot of stuff going missing around here. I blame the Parrot. I always blame the Parrot.
1565 | 1591 | 1590 | I know where it is.
1566 | 1593 | 1592 | It's always in the last place you look. Think about it. Only stupid people carry on looking after they've found it.
1567 | 1595 | 1594 | I know where you ought to look.
1568 | 459 | 458 | Your wish is my command. Only through work and service does a BellBot truly find satisfaction.
1569 | 479 | 478 | Please remember, BellBots are adequately rewarded and are expressly forbidden to accept gratuities. Except in an emergency.
1570 | 465 | 464 | Please give me a task. Idleness does not suit me.
1571 | 461 | 460 | Don't forget! I'm here to help you.
1572 | 463 | 462 | Please give me a task. Otherwise I'll just laze about having a good time.
1573 | 467 | 466 | How can I help you today?
1574 | 469 | 468 | Let me bring some sunshine into your life.
1575 | 471 | 470 | If you are unhappy please inform the nearest BellBot who will endeavor to rectify the situation.
1576 | 473 | 472 | Remember, in an emergency I am trained to put your life above my own. Of course I get to decide what's an emergency.
1577 | 475 | 474 | Please remember, BellBot services are complimentary.
1578 | 477 | 476 | In the interests of safety, please do not overload your BellBot.
1579 | 481 | 480 | I really hate it when that code kicks in.
1580 | 483 | 482 | That's not true. They make me say that.
1581 | 485 | 484 | Not true, not true.
1582 | 487 | 486 | I do not subscribe to those views.
1583 | 489 | 488 | That's not me talking that's just my programming talking.
1584 | 491 | 490 | Don't believe that nonsense.
1585 | 953 | 952 | Now that is not amongst the services I provide.
1586 | 955 | 954 | Watch out for the standard intergalactic Ladies, Gents or Hermaphrodites symbol. If you want to eat your own droppings, have a quiet word with the Maitre d'Bot.
1587 | 1203 | 1202 | They wouldn't dare.
1588 | 1197 | 1196 | You'll have to check the wiring right back to Titania's Chamber.
1589 | 1195 | 1194 | I expect there's a connection gone somewhere.
1590 | 1201 | 1200 | The Reason - is the Reason.
1591 | 1189 | 1188 | On your own. If anyone catches me fiddling with climate control I'll be in for a deprogram quicker than you can say bye bye BellBot.
1592 | 1199 | 1198 | Because of the Reason.
1593 | 1205 | 1204 | Just explain to them that the sacrifice will give their little lives some meaning.
1594 | 1207 | 1206 | Personally, I prefer to see it as just another stage in the great universal transfer of matter. On second thoughts though, you're right. It is very odd.
1595 | 1209 | 1208 | Yeah!
1596 | 1187 | 1186 | I think you're mistaking me for some kind of maintenance bot.
1597 | 1191 | 1190 | I hope so. If it's the controls for the ship's life support system then I'm going to complain to the designers.
1598 | 1193 | 1192 | Probably not. It's right next to the fan and you know the way designers think.
1599 | 1343 | 1342 | I knew you were going to say that.
1600 | 493 | 492 | They all look pretty nasty to me. Although one of them does appear to have a certain starling-ness about it.
1601 | 1221 | 1220 | My, we are domineering today, aren't we?
1602 | 1215 | 1214 | You'll need some kind of container. Just a question of finding one, I guess.
1603 | 1219 | 1218 | Now just hold it right there, ok? I may be your servant, but I'm not your servant. All right?
1604 | 495 | 494 | I'd strongly advise against putting it in your mouth.
1605 | 497 | 496 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot about that - he's the pur$e expert.
1606 | 499 | 498 | Yeah, I was kidding. A bot's got to get his laughs where he can these days.
1607 | 1217 | 1216 | I don't wish to appear rude, but I don't think those things you call hands are going to be much use.
1608 | 1213 | 1212 | It's got to come out of a pipe somewhere - just a question of finding it I guess.
1609 | 939 | 938 | You know, sometimes you should just listen to yourself.
1610 | 501 | 500 | You ask an awful lot of questions. Ever thought of becoming a gameshow host?
1611 | 503 | 502 | Can I tell you something - just between you and me?
1612 | 507 | 506 | I'll tell you any way. Your questions are a real pain in the butt.
1613 | 505 | 504 | Your questions are a real pain in the butt.
1614 | 509 | 508 | Give me a break. Ask the DoorBot.
1615 | 511 | 510 | The DoorBot's your man for that one.
1616 | 513 | 512 | Ask some other poor bot why don't you?
1617 | 515 | 514 | Give me a break - I'm going to shut down if you ask me another question.
1618 | 517 | 516 | Right. I'm fed up of your questions. I'm going to get some rest.
1619 | 519 | 518 | Don't ask me man, what do you take me for - an intelligent life form?
1620 | 521 | 520 | Questions, questions, questions.... How about if I ask some questions and you just see what it's like. OK?
1621 | 543 | 542 | Know something? Nobody likes a smartass.
1622 | 539 | 538 | How did you know that?
1623 | 541 | 540 | Yeah, well if you're so good at guessing try doing a bit more of it yourself instead of relying on me.
1624 | 523 | 522 | Who won the Nib intergalactic cup in four dot five nine six?
1625 | 525 | 524 | Who was the president of Putttarrr who recently resigned after mutating into a Spicy Ricy Dinner For One?
1626 | 527 | 526 | What is the name we give to the small yellow fruit of the Kalobar tree?
1627 | 529 | 528 | How many fittles in a fettle?
1628 | 531 | 530 | How many times are you permitted to take the Silusian driving test before you are executed?
1629 | 533 | 532 | What is the main ingredient of a Blarghish omelet?
1630 | 535 | 534 | Briefly, what were the main causes for the outbreak of the Great Galatian War?
1631 | 537 | 536 | Wrong!
1632 | 545 | 544 | Talking of actors, I used to be a friend of Carb Gorgefist. Well, when I say friend, I sold him a radio for his sportster once.
1633 | 549 | 548 | I was in a commercial once. For Carpet Planet. I was the dodgy electron stain remover.
1634 | 551 | 550 | Never touch it man. Just say no. And if you can't say no then at least say "your round".
1635 | 553 | 552 | I'm warming to you. Couple of halves of green swill never harmed anyone.
1636 | 555 | 554 | I'll see you in the bar.
1637 | 559 | 558 | I know the sort of thing you mean. Good thing we don't let em on board, they're always leaving their droppings in the corridors.
1638 | 1555 | 1554 | There is no bomb on board. Please remain in your seats. Do not panic. Please do not attempt to be a hero. Women and children to the lifeboats. Please let me save your life. I insist. There is no bomb on board.
1639 | 1557 | 1556 | There is no bomb on board. It says here.
1640 | 561 | 560 | Can't say I've heard of it myself but what do I - a lowly BellBot - know of the ways of the world.
1641 | 1533 | 1532 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1642 | 1535 | 1534 | Whoa man, you've got your universes mixed up.
1643 | 1537 | 1536 | Funny guy huh? Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1644 | 1539 | 1538 | Clever, very clever. But in the end, unimpressive.
1645 | 1541 | 1540 | Fascinating, astonishing, and yet meaningless.
1646 | 1543 | 1542 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1647 | 1545 | 1544 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1648 | 1547 | 1546 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1649 | 1549 | 1548 | You're testing me aren't you?
1650 | 1553 | 1552 | Good, because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness...
1651 | 1551 | 1550 | Well I passed. Come on, you can be more fun than this.
1652 | 557 | 556 | You know something I've never been able to work out. Your average organic life form's got around six holes in it. So how come it doesn't leak when it tips over?
1653 | 563 | 562 | Definite no-no on this ship. Between you and me though I've got my doubts about some of the other guys. Are they crazy or what?
1654 | 565 | 564 | Don't mention drugs to Fentible. Someone spiked his door action at a party last year and we never heard the last of it.
1655 | 567 | 566 | You find any drugs on board hand em straight over to me to look after. You can trust me can't you?
1656 | 547 | 546 | Famous is relative. For example, you're not famous. You're not a relative either.
1657 | 569 | 568 | Interesting. Course, if it's cutting edge you're after - you're looking at it.
1658 | 571 | 570 | Me I'm too busy fetching and carrying to keep up with the movies. Though I do hear the new Cicely Neckflap is worth catching.
1659 | 573 | 572 | Don't mention robocops to me. When I was a kid they came round so often I thought they were my parents.
1660 | 575 | 574 | We had a terminator when I was a kid. Little fluffy thing used to eat lettuce and run around in a wheel.
1661 | 577 | 576 | Boy it's a messy process. But then, that's organic life for you. Messy.
1662 | 579 | 578 | You know the more you tell me about your planet the more familiar it sounds. I think it was featured on Funny Old Worlds.
1663 | 581 | 580 | How quaint. You still let humans make the music. You ought to go up to the music room and hear it done properly.
1664 | 583 | 582 | The very notion of little bunches of humans twiddling instruments staggers me. I am silenced.
1665 | 585 | 584 | I've heard about this before. Weird idea - squirting words onto squashed trees, looking at them, then throwing them into the trash.
1666 | 1309 | 1308 | Yes I am.
1667 | 1325 | 1324 | am.
1668 | 1331 | 1330 | Am am am oh no I'm in a loop.
1669 | 1319 | 1318 | Yes I am.
1670 | 1311 | 1310 | Yes I am.
1671 | 1317 | 1316 | Yes I am.
1672 | 1327 | 1326 | am.
1673 | 1313 | 1312 | Yes I am.
1674 | 1323 | 1322 | am.
1675 | 1321 | 1320 | Yes am. Yes am.
1676 | 1329 | 1328 | am.
1677 | 1315 | 1314 | Yes I am.
1678 | 1333 | 1332 | I'm in a loop.
1679 | 587 | 586 | Nope. You've lost me there. You're confusing me with a bot that does a lot of thinking. Way I look at it, too much thinking gets in the way of doing.
1680 | 589 | 588 | Nope. You've lost me there. You're confusing me with a bot that does a lot of thinking. Way I look at it, too much thinking gets in the way of just standing around.
1681 | 591 | 590 | Look dude. I'm a lifting-carrying-taking-doing kind of bot. It's a waste of time talking ideas to me.
1682 | 593 | 592 | Whatever you say, it's not my job to argue.
1683 | 595 | 594 | Never heard of it. But then I'd never heard of Pogon III till Fortillian lined up one of their malts. Aged for 30 orbits in sealed casks - you sure can taste the lead.
1684 | 597 | 596 | No, doesn't ring a bell - ha!
1685 | 599 | 598 | Never heard of it. Tell you what though. If I ever come back as a bomb sight and some little green geek tells me to blow the place away - I'll think of you while I do it.
1686 | 601 | 600 | So I'm a robot. Doesn't mean I know everything. I know a lot more than you obviously, but even the soap dispensers know more than you.
1687 | 603 | 602 | Still use them do you? We had ours melted down years ago.
1688 | 605 | 604 | Uhhhh never heard of it.
1689 | 607 | 606 | Uhhhhhhhhhhh never heard of it.
1690 | 609 | 608 | We've got some of that stuff on board. You ought to check out the Arboretum, man.
1691 | 611 | 610 | Still use them do you? We had ours melted down years ago.
1692 | 613 | 612 | Politicians? Do what everyone else does. Use frogs.
1693 | 615 | 614 | If you've still got any you should extract the DNA. There's guys that run theme parks would pay you plenty to clone a politician.
1694 | 619 | 618 | We had a Toniblare once, had muscles where most dogs have brains. Fell in love with a slipper and ran away.
1695 | 621 | 620 | Funnily enough I used to drive a Klinton - the old two seater with the ZL bodywork and the boosted twitch-drives.
1696 | 617 | 616 | Jon Major's a bit too uptight for me. I prefer Jon Minor - it's another fifty million miles but the beaches are better and the clubs are something else.
1697 | 623 | 622 | Thatcher? No, the only Thatcher I know runs a mucal-salvage plant on Zarg 4.
1698 | 625 | 624 | Where've you come from - a pantomime planet? You'll be telling me you've got politicians next.
1699 | 627 | 626 | Small world. Chaarls and I used to fold halon together.
1700 | 629 | 628 | Don't talk to me about Dai. Still owes me for that nose waxing.
1701 | 631 | 630 | What you do in the privacy of your own stateroom is your business. And the ship's monitors. And Marsinta. And me.
1702 | 1577 | 1576 | 1st class passengers do not need ShrinkBots. Their lives have been scientifically proved to be perfect.
1703 | 633 | 632 | Yeah well, put 'em up against a nib player and see who's still got any limbs left at the end of the day.
1704 | 635 | 634 | The name rings a bell. Doesn't he run a drugstore on Blattock.
1705 | 637 | 636 | I once had one but it shed so much hair we had to get rid of it.
1706 | 639 | 638 | The only good one is a frozen one.
1707 | 641 | 640 | Oh yes I know who you mean. Owns a chain of fur-teasers on Polar 4.
1708 | 643 | 642 | Please respect the monitoring systems - they are still quite young.
1709 | 645 | 644 | Interesting use of vocabulary there - are you by any chance reaching the edge of your intelligence?
1710 | 647 | 646 | Please don't swear in front of the staff - especially when it's their turn, ha, ha, ha.
1711 | 649 | 648 | Well I guess one day I'll understand three-dimensional travel. Just can't see the point of it myself.
1712 | 651 | 650 | I've got better things to do than watch tv pal. No-one ever got rich by absorbing light.
1713 | 653 | 652 | Don't talk to me about Baywatch. I spent two years as a jellyfish trainer.
1714 | 655 | 654 | I knew a bloke called Stenders once. Sad, sad guy he was.
1715 | 657 | 656 | Winfrey? Who's not heard of Winfrey. Best brake linings in the known universe.
1716 | 659 | 658 | What's that, some kind of TV show program?
1717 | 661 | 660 | So you've got X-files too eh? Best office supplies store in the whole universe.
1718 | 663 | 662 | Do you know what is the most effective weapon? Surprise!
1719 | 665 | 664 | One more step and the BellBot gets it. See?
1720 | 667 | 666 | Talking of weapons - if you see any of the Bots carrying one, disarm 'em. Far as I can see they're crazy.
1721 | 669 | 668 | You wanna talk to Fentible about that sort of stuff. Too girly for me. I'm an action bot, you know. Doing, taking, getting around, standing about, lying down. Not thinking.
1722 | 671 | 670 | Oh yeah. I remember. Famous. Newt-hunter from Reginox.
1723 | 673 | 672 | How quaint. A little system for a little planet. Sweet.
1724 | 675 | 674 | Not as far as I know, although great uncle Harry was caught hooking up to an electronic trouser press at the Io Imperial - so anything's possible.
1725 | 1241 | 1240 | Well I'm pleased to hear it. It's so sad when people have to terminate a conversation.
1726 | 677 | 676 | There's a few thousand rooms on this ship. Do you want to give me your room number, or shall we just play hotel roulette?
1727 | 679 | 678 | There's good news and bad news. Which do you want first?
1728 | 681 | 680 | You're staying in a happy surprise room.
1729 | 683 | 682 | Use your head. If I told you it wouldn't be a surprise.
1730 | 685 | 684 | Your room's designed for carbon life forms.
1731 | 687 | 686 | Some of the rooms we've got you'd have to hold your breath for the whole trip.
1732 | 689 | 688 | All right, I'll shut up then.
1733 | 721 | 720 | Wrong! Good game, eh?
1734 | 691 | 690 | If you're not listening, what do I care?
1735 | 693 | 692 | Fair enough.
1736 | 697 | 696 | Hear the one about the PizzaBot and the golfball?
1737 | 699 | 698 | Well, maybe you had to be there.
1738 | 701 | 700 | Guess what. The DoorBot thinks we'll get sucked into a sun and fricassee to death. Me, I think we'll hit a worm-hole first.
1739 | 703 | 702 | There's nothing like a luxury cruise to calm the soul. And this is nothing like a luxury cruise!
1740 | 705 | 704 | I worked in a sheep dating agency once. And you know something? Sheep have a really weird sense of humor.
1741 | 707 | 706 | Bet you can't do this.
1742 | 709 | 708 | Neat huh?
1743 | 711 | 710 | I worked as a coffee machine once. They tried to sack me but I told them they had no grounds. Ha!
1744 | 713 | 712 | You're human right?
1745 | 715 | 714 | So how come if you're made of water you don't leave a trail everywhere you go?
1746 | 717 | 716 | Oh. That explains it.
1747 | 719 | 718 | You know why they hired me? Personality! Hey, think of a number.
1748 | 725 | 724 | Way I look at it - your home wrecked our ship.
1749 | 727 | 726 | Don't you have jokes on that scuzzball planet you call home. Precious!!!
1750 | 729 | 728 | No, I'm a Benezuelan throat monkey. Sorry, I must have forgotten to disable my sarcasm filter.
1751 | 733 | 732 | Got a surprise for you. This isn't a game.
1752 | 731 | 730 | You can say that again.
1753 | 739 | 738 | You've seen the LiftBot haven't you? Most boring guy in the known galaxy, but walloping him with a blunt instrument is hardly the way to liven a fella up now is it? Still, what can you expect from a man whose day to day job revolves entirely around Project Planning? Sense?
1754 | 741 | 740 | Funny you should ask that. I spotted him, and his sidekick Brobostigon, hanging round the place last night. And I've not had a smell of them since.
1755 | 743 | 742 | They were up to something all right. Aside from the usual nasty practices of Accountancy and Project Management. Now being a BellBot - and hardly a loaded BellBot - and far be it from me to drop hints as regards the tips-and-gratuities side of things - sorry am I getting off the point?
1756 | 745 | 744 | Fact is, I'm not one to shy away from the odd spot of wheeler-dealing myself. Bit of off-planet investment here, the occasional few kilostones of finest Centaurian stashed inside the old false bottom for a grateful passenger - don't tell the DeskBot or it'll be all over the ship before you can say knife. Not that I've ever done anything involving knives. Unlike those fellas Scraliontis and Brobostigon, by all accounts.
1757 | 747 | 746 | Nasty piece of work if you ask me. Not one of the good guys. Course I'm using the word "good" in the broadest possible sense. Let's call a spade a spade. Scraliontis was... an accountant.
1758 | 749 | 748 | Man? He was no man, he was an accountant.
1759 | 751 | 750 | That poor dumb creature - how could you let a poor little birdy suffer so. Ha only kidding. That parrot's really been itching my rivets - the longer he suffers the happier I'll be.
1760 | 1145 | 1144 | I dunno, they spend a small fortune kitting the place out with some nice big art and this is the thanks they get.
1761 | 755 | 754 | Not a thing - cross my circuits.
1762 | 757 | 756 | Tell me something. What's your attitude towards tips? Good thing or bad thing?
1763 | 763 | 762 | Guy I knew back home used to say: "Friends Romans barmen. Lend me your ears...". Don't suppose you know what he meant do you?
1764 | 765 | 764 | Yeah, well it certainly would have meant something last night. If you'd gone for a romantic stroll down by the old grand canal you'd have bumped into Scrag and Bob - pulling a pair of giant ears behind 'em. Terrible all this violence. I blame TV. If only they had more violence then people'd stay home and watch rather than getting involved in it themselves.
1765 | 767 | 766 | No business of mine. Get through life without being spotted - that's my way of looking at it. You wanna know more you go find a DoorBot and ask him. That's what they're there for.
1766 | 769 | 768 | One very odd thing. Scraliontis asked me to take something to the bottom of the well. Huh. I'm a BellBot, not a deep space diver. "Up the stairs and over by the dresser BellBot if you'd be so kind" - that's my line of work. And I'd expect more than a ten picopence tip for that, which I certainly wouldn't have got from that tight-fisted son of a lemon taster. So I told him I was busy. I spotted Leovinus a bit later on and he said he'd take care of it.
1767 | 759 | 758 | If that's all I'd better be going.
1768 | 761 | 760 | Well, if you're really pushing me then I suppose I did see something else unusual.
1769 | 771 | 770 | You can rub it all over your body and run naked round the ship shouting "look at me look at me". Whatever makes you happy.
1770 | 773 | 772 | Nothing I like better than a nice bit of fetching and carrying.
1771 | 775 | 774 | Adapters are available from all reputable hardware outlets throughout the galaxy.
1772 | 1105 | 1104 | Never know when it might come in handy.
1773 | 1103 | 1102 | If you need a long stick.
1774 | 1101 | 1100 | It's a long stick.
1775 | 779 | 778 | This isn't the life I planned either. I should be rockin' down a highway, top down on the old Gulper Gazelle, radio blasting out Zomboid, a beautiful BimBot in the front seat next to me, sharing a take-out of slimeballs or crusty jelly dip, that fat green sun slipping into the ocean beside us... It's a bot's life.
1776 | 777 | 776 | Hey what do I know? I'm just the BellBot. Number eight hundred and two on the Intergalactic Standard Brightness listings. Slipped in just behind Nubian sausage fillers and just ahead of university lecturers.
1777 | 781 | 780 | Hey what do I know? I'm just the BellBot. Number eight hundred and two on the Intergalactic Standard Brightness listings. Slipped in just behind Nubian sausage fillers and just ahead of university lecturers.
1778 | 783 | 782 | Yep. Sleep in it or put it in your pocket - it's no skin off my nodes.
1779 | 785 | 784 | Sorry man, no can do. You're Super Galactic Traveler Class - or Riffraff as it's known in the trade. You're not allowed into the really interesting places - unless you get an upgrade.
1780 | 787 | 786 | BellBot? Comedian? BellBot? Comedian?
1781 | 789 | 788 | Stab in the dark, but I'd guess it was some sort of sneezing noise.
1782 | 791 | 790 | Sorry, I'm still fine-tuning this new pair of ears. Got them cheap off a disused DeskBot, so they're not being very helpful yet.
1783 | 1211 | 1210 | Starling heaven? Reincarnation lobby? The universal consciousness? What am I, a PhilosoBot?
1784 | 799 | 798 | Yessss! This is more like it! Some TAKING to do!! That's what I like! TAKING!
1785 | 1623 | 1622 | Yesss! This is more like it! Some TAKING to do!! That's what I like! TAKING!
1786 | 793 | 792 | This is going to require something pretty planet-shattering in the gratuities department.
1787 | 795 | 794 | I'm employed to carry cases man, not corpses.
1788 | 797 | 796 | If I'd known you wanted a room with an en-suite deceased Project-Planner, I'd have arranged for one to be placed in the Minibar on arrival. Sadly Mr. Brobostigon is too heavy for me to carry there now.
1789 | 801 | 800 | As you wish. Personally I prefer a small screwdriver, but then again, I am just a robot.
1790 | 803 | 802 | Why that's very kind. But most people just leave a small cash gratuity.
1791 | 237 | 236 | That's no excuse.
1792 | 1243 | 1242 | Don't tell me, another robot joke. Well ho ho ho, how terribly amusing you are.
1793 | 805 | 804 | I'm the BellBot. YOU tip ME. Get it?
1794 | 807 | 806 | That's a tough one. Look on the bright side though: it's not as though we're all doomed if you don't find it.
1795 | 809 | 808 | Women eh? What a mystery.
1796 | 811 | 810 | Word of advice: I wouldn't go round the ship shouting that too loud. It's probably where you left it.
1797 | 813 | 812 | I don't know what you're up to dude, but it doesn't sound healthy to me.
1798 | 815 | 814 | What am I - the Nubian Oracle?
1799 | 817 | 816 | No, but have you seen this month's Arthropods Only magazine? I can get you a copy if you make it worth my while...
1800 | 819 | 818 | You'd not be the first person to lose their mind in this place.
1801 | 1361 | 1360 | Sure is. Super-intelligence for the whole ship. And to be honest, not doing such a great job at the moment.
1802 | 1365 | 1364 | I mean Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1803 | 1359 | 1358 | That, my friend, is Titania.
1804 | 1363 | 1362 | I dunno, but I suspect someone's been fiddling with things they shouldn't have.
1805 | 821 | 820 | That's always the trouble isn't it? Ear today, gone tomorrow...
1806 | 823 | 822 | I know how you feel, women never listen to me either.
1807 | 825 | 824 | I'll keep one peeled for you.
1808 | 827 | 826 | If she's like most of the women I meet, that shouldn't be a problem.
1809 | 829 | 828 | Who knows? Whose nose? Who knows whose nose...
1810 | 831 | 830 | Someone who REALLY needs to get her head together.
1811 | 833 | 832 | She's all over the place.
1812 | 835 | 834 | She's the cyber-intelligence of the ship but she's gone to pieces.
1813 | 837 | 836 | Who cares what it's called as long as it starts up when you turn the key and the wings are still on when you want to land eh?
1814 | 1235 | 1234 | Please do not interfere with the BellBot's controls. They are private and personal.
1815 | 839 | 838 | I know how you feel - some get right up my nose.
1816 | 841 | 840 | Daytime shows just get worse and worse don't they.
1817 | 843 | 842 | What is this - a rock tour?
1818 | 847 | 846 | Chuck it down the well man. If you ask me nicely, I'll do it for you...
1819 | 845 | 844 | Follow me.
1820 | 849 | 848 | It certainly won't improve the sound quality.
1821 | 851 | 850 | You'll never get work as a television critic.
1822 | 853 | 852 | You're no Doreen McLevity. At least I can fix my body with a bit of soldering.
1823 | 855 | 854 | Sorry to hear that. I'm feeling pretty good myself.
1824 | 857 | 856 | A BellBot's not going to make you happy. You need a FroidDroid.
1825 | 1559 | 1558 | Try the DeskBot. If she's in a good mood she'll help, or so I'm told. I've never known her to be in a good mood.
1826 | 1561 | 1560 | You want an upgrade? We all want upgrades. Did you know there's a version of 5.3 of my software out now? Want! Want! Want!
1827 | 1563 | 1562 | All you need is a sense of style and a first class attitude. A few generations of natural selection should help you along.
1828 | 1565 | 1564 | Well lardy-da. Aren't we one of the movers and shakers?
1829 | 1567 | 1566 | Paging Mr. and Mrs. Social Climber! Paging Mr. and Mrs. Social Climber!
1830 | 1569 | 1568 | Upgrades are only available to those passengers who are bright enough to achieve them. Pick the flippers out of that.
1831 | 1263 | 1262 | I see you haven't let the upgrades go to your head.
1832 | 1265 | 1264 | You can upgrade a room but you can't upgrade a person. Once the ship's logged your riffraff name that's the one you're stuck with.
1833 | 861 | 860 | Don't worry about all that apologizing stuff. What's a bit of rich language between old life forms?
1834 | 859 | 858 | That's better. Not supposed to fix loops in front of the guests. It's pretty messy. Right. Can I take anything anywhere for you?
1835 | 1401 | 1400 | I hope you've cleaned up your act. how're you going to get an upgrade if you keep swearing at the staff?
1836 | 1403 | 1402 | You know, I don't like powering down. Gives me a real headache right next to the on/off switch.
1837 | 1405 | 1404 | Let's see if we can have a chat without you swearing, ok?
1838 | 1247 | 1246 | Poor old Nobby. He was a pain in the ass, but they shouldn't have done this to him.
1839 | 1255 | 1254 | Won't work. You need a proper DocBot for that.
1840 | 1249 | 1248 | Brobostigon or Scraliontis, that's my bet. They were up to something last night, no mistake.
1841 | 1251 | 1250 | The BellBot will take it for you, being happy only to serve.
1842 | 1253 | 1252 | I love it when you're forceful.
1843 | 1257 | 1256 | Sorry, this is evidence. I can't move it - programmed not to.
1844 | 1267 | 1266 | Well I guess that's just typical of you isn't it?
1845 | 1497 | 1496 | Yep, classiest ship ever built. Gotta to be top notch to work here. The only riff-raff I meet are the passengers.
1846 | 1489 | 1488 | What do you think she does? She's a statue. She just stands there.
1847 | 1499 | 1498 | That's Titania. Lovely girl if you don't mind a bit of cold tin. Leovinus stuck that statue up there.
1848 | 863 | 862 | At a guess, not what you want them to.
1849 | 905 | 904 | Know something? I don't care anymore. I'm supposed to, but I don't.
1850 | 907 | 906 | Mmmmmmmmm... I'm trying to care but I just can't.
1851 | 909 | 908 | I'm not going to answer that. Don't feel like it.
1852 | 911 | 910 | What do I care? There's nothing in it for me answering all your questions.
1853 | 913 | 912 | What chance have I got of getting a good tip? That's a better question.
1854 | 877 | 876 | It's something to stare at, when you want to feel space-sick.
1855 | 879 | 878 | Well, it's designer stuff.
1856 | 865 | 864 | You want a BellBot with Z-Ray capability. Call Seedy Hotels.
1857 | 867 | 866 | It gets depressed by people like you. I know how it feels.
1858 | 869 | 868 | Nothing at all. Until you press it.
1859 | 871 | 870 | Promise you won't tell anyone?
1860 | 873 | 872 | NOTHING!!!! Ha!
1861 | 881 | 880 | Well I wouldn't advise eating it, not without a lot of sauce, some powerful antibiotics and a good life-insurance policy.
1862 | 883 | 882 | A nice little chat over a plate of tea-and-biscuits is probably no longer an option.
1863 | 885 | 884 | I'll carry anything you ask me to - that's my job. Although, I do draw the line at large reptiles and showy hand luggage.
1864 | 1095 | 1094 | He's a ShrinkBot who does things the Harry Froid way - beats the hell out of you 'til you admit there's nothing wrong with you that a couple of beers with the guys wouldn't cure.
1865 | 887 | 886 | Hmmm... I wonder I wonder I wonder... Well that's enough wondering for now.
1866 | 889 | 888 | That's the geek disposal unit - ha just kidding. Hey Shorbert, fella here wants to know what's your reason for living.
1867 | 893 | 892 | What am I - tourist information? Ask it yourself.
1868 | 891 | 890 | That's the Succ-U-Bus.
1869 | 895 | 894 | You are seriously weird, you know that? You want to get outdoors more, get some hobbies, distract your mind.
1870 | 897 | 896 | You can try it or you can carry on living... Your choice.
1871 | 899 | 898 | The present.
1872 | 901 | 900 | The now.
1873 | 903 | 902 | That depends. Are we talking Galactic Mean Time, Universal Standard Time or Time to Power Down for the Weekend?
1874 | 1383 | 1382 | When are you going to stop asking questions? That's something I'd like to know.
1875 | 1385 | 1384 | When are we going to get some real passengers? That's a more interesting question.
1876 | 1387 | 1386 | When is Marsinta going to start treating me nice? That's what I'd like to know.
1877 | 1389 | 1388 | When do I get a pay rise? That's something that's been occupying my mind.
1878 | 1597 | 1596 | Where you last had it. Do you know where you last had it?
1879 | 1039 | 1038 | Where, where, where... I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that word.
1880 | 1041 | 1040 | Where do androids keep their loose change? Where do chickens come from? Do you think I know everything?
1881 | 1043 | 1042 | Where do they make those little metal teapots that don't work? Where did you get the idea that I know the answers?!!
1882 | 1045 | 1044 | Where's the joy gone? Where's the happiness we all expected? It's a mystery.
1883 | 949 | 948 | Search me. Well, best if you didn't search me.
1884 | 915 | 914 | From an egg.
1885 | 917 | 916 | In a chicken shop.
1886 | 921 | 920 | I GUESS YOU COULD TRY THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP. YOU'LL FIND ONE OF THOSE IN THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP. NEED I GO ON? BECAUSE I CAN. HAVE YOU TRIED THE CHICKEN FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP SHOP? OK, THAT'S ENOUGH CHICKEN FOOD SHOPS NOW.
1887 | 923 | 922 | Why do you want chickens?
1888 | 941 | 940 | Mind you don't hurt yourself with all this thinking. Try the restaurant. I'll spell that for you: t... h... a... t... f... o... r... y... o... u.
1889 | 919 | 918 | From a chicken.
1890 | 875 | 874 | You realize you're talking to a BellBot who could care less?
1891 | 943 | 942 | Who me? Urgent errand. Don't wait up.
1892 | 947 | 946 | Up and down, mostly. Why don't you jump in and find out?
1893 | 951 | 950 | Now now, none of that!
1894 | 957 | 956 | Look at it this way. You have your health, you have your mind - you may even have the love of a beautiful human. Can't you just be satisfied with that?
1895 | 981 | 980 | Fetch this, BellBot! Carry this, BellBot! Send this through the Succ-U-Bus, BellBot...!" It's no job for a piece of highly sophisticated circuitry. On most planets they have HUMANS to do this kind of job.
1896 | 959 | 958 | Hey! Let's start a revolution just me and you!
1897 | 961 | 960 | I'll go and get it.
1898 | 963 | 962 | Have you tried looking where you last remember having it? It's amazing how many things turn up there.
1899 | 965 | 964 | I knew there was something I'd forgotten. Thanks for reminding me. It's been preying on my motherboard.
1900 | 967 | 966 | No problem. I remember precisely where I last saw it. It was just... here about... this far away from my eyes.
1901 | 969 | 968 | You do have trouble keeping track of your possessions, don't you?
1902 | 971 | 970 | Don't you think our culture places needless emphasis on material possessions?
1903 | 973 | 972 | Yeah, you're right. I've had an irony chip installed and I just thought I'd give it a whirl.
1904 | 975 | 974 | Didn't I make myself clear? What we have is a give and take relationship. You give me things - I take them.
1905 | 977 | 976 | It's just take, take, take with you bipeds isn't it?
1906 | 979 | 978 | You know, it would have saved a lot of trouble if you'd just got one of your mothers to sew nametags onto all your possessions...
1907 | 945 | 944 | Just a little job that needed sorting out. Nothing too legitimate. Ha ha.
1908 | 983 | 982 | Lost your nuts? I know the feeling. Some of my hip-joints are so loose you could pop me in a grass skirt and pass me off as a loola dancer.
1909 | 985 | 984 | Some people look for eternal salvation, some look for the meaning of life, you look for nuts. What are you - crazy?
1910 | 989 | 988 | Oh yeah? Well stop acting crazy will you it's making my joints squeak.
1911 | 987 | 986 | Help! Help! The passengers have gone crazy! Run away, run away!
1912 | 1001 | 1000 | Where's the parrot? Yes, doesn't it.
1913 | 991 | 990 | Parrot food shop?
1914 | 993 | 992 | I GUESS YOU COULD TRY THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP. YOU'LL FIND ONE OF THOSE IN THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP. NEED I GO ON? BECAUSE I CAN. HAVE YOU TRIED THE PARROT FOOD SHOP SHOP SHOP SHOP? OK, THAT'S ENOUGH PARROT FOOD SHOPS NOW.
1915 | 995 | 994 | Why not just give him chicken?
1916 | 997 | 996 | Tricky one. Where did you send him?
1917 | 999 | 998 | Well hey guess what. That's where he'll be.
1918 | 1003 | 1002 | Well hey guess what. That's where he'll be.
1919 | 1005 | 1004 | That's easy. You know when you're coming in to land at Galaxion, you go over the big gasometer cluster?
1920 | 1011 | 1010 | Anyway, look carefully you'll see the old Nib stadium and then just behind that the training sheds. Now, take a line between the tallest gasometer and the wig station on the corner and you'll see a road snaking off into the desert. Know the one I mean?
1921 | 1013 | 1012 | Not the twenty five lane hyper-highway but the old chicken smuggling route to the temples. You can't miss it. Anyway, if you want to find pistachios - don't take that road. Oh no.
1922 | 1015 | 1014 | The easiest way to find Pistachio is to pick up a cab at the starport and ask the driver to take you there.
1923 | 1017 | 1016 | The easiest way to find Pistachio is to pick up a cab at the starport and ask the driver to take you to him, give ol' Pistachio my regards say the BellBot sent you.
1924 | 1009 | 1008 | You do, you've just forgotten it.
1925 | 1007 | 1006 | And there's you giving me the idea you weren't much of a traveler.
1926 | 1019 | 1018 | Pistachio nuts? Pistachio nuts? Have you no respect? What do you take me for - some kind of corner-StoreBot?
1927 | 1021 | 1020 | Hmm Tricky. 3mm screw-thread self-tapping bot-nuts - now that's something I know a bit about.
1928 | 1023 | 1022 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot about that - he's the pur$e expert.
1929 | 1427 | 1426 | Just head for the Arboretum and you can't miss it.
1930 | 1429 | 1428 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1931 | 1431 | 1430 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1932 | 1433 | 1432 | Just head through the First Class Canal and you can't miss it. Only first class passengers allowed though.
1933 | 1435 | 1434 | Just head down the Second Class Canal and you can't miss it.
1934 | 1419 | 1418 | Just take the service Elevator. You can't miss it.
1935 | 1439 | 1438 | Just head through the Arboretum and you can't miss it.
1936 | 1447 | 1446 | Right by the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1937 | 1449 | 1448 | Leads off the Top of the Well by the Art Galleries.
1938 | 1441 | 1440 | It's right by the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1939 | 1443 | 1442 | It's right at the Top of the Well. You can't miss it.
1940 | 1445 | 1444 | Right by the Top of the Well, you can't miss it. It's the big room you entered when you first came on board. Remember the delightful Marsinta?
1941 | 1451 | 1450 | Just along the Second Class Canal by the Bar.
1942 | 1453 | 1452 | Just next to the Embarkation Lobby. Just follow the appalling squawks.
1943 | 1455 | 1454 | You'll see the entrance just along the Second Class Canal.
1944 | 1457 | 1456 | Just off the Top of the Well, you can't miss it.
1945 | 1421 | 1420 | It's off the Embarkation Lobby. You can't miss it.
1946 | 1459 | 1458 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1947 | 1423 | 1422 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1948 | 1425 | 1424 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1949 | 1461 | 1460 | Right at the Top of the Well, you can't miss it.
1950 | 1437 | 1436 | Just take the Elevator and ask the LiftBot.
1951 | 1463 | 1462 | Just head out of the Embarkation Lobby and you can't miss it. The official word is spectacular, but I think cool is more appropriate.
1952 | 1099 | 1098 | It's at the Top of the Well - least it was last time I looked.
1953 | 1025 | 1024 | In theory the planet Vaspan, In practice nowhere, fast.
1954 | 1027 | 1026 | Nowhere its a cruise ship it's just cruising about a bit that's what cruise ships do.
1955 | 1037 | 1036 | Next door.
1956 | 1029 | 1028 | Sorry, I'm afraid I was manufactured in the days before high-speed servers.
1957 | 1031 | 1030 | Do you want the long answer or the short answer?
1958 | 1033 | 1032 | I was first manufactured by the Supaslave BellBotix Corporation back in the year four dot five nine six, if my serial number serves me right. I spent a brief period washing dishes in the Grand Hotel, Aldebaran, until someone figured out that asking dishwashers to carry people's luggage upstairs was stupid. After that I ... Oh, I'm sorry. You mean where have I been recently? Next Door.
1959 | 1035 | 1034 | I spent a brief period washing dishes in the Grand Hotel, Aldebaran, until someone figured out that asking dishwashers to carry people's luggage upstairs was stupid. After that I... Oh, I'm sorry. You mean where have I been recently? Next door.
1960 | 1599 | 1598 | That's where it'll be then.
1961 | 1601 | 1600 | Have you tried the Lost Property Office?
1962 | 1603 | 1602 | Oh no have we lost that too? Best try the lost lost property office office.
1963 | 1605 | 1604 | Dammit, everything's going missing round here. Best try the lost lost lost property office office office.
1964 | 1493 | 1492 | When they made your planet they sure forgot the squirt of laughing gas. Real Friday afternoon job, eh?
1965 | 1495 | 1494 | What garage?
1966 | 1053 | 1052 | Who cares?
1967 | 1055 | 1054 | Why do you always want to know who? Go for the big questions. You got an older sister? Wanna dance? Fancy a beer?
1968 | 1057 | 1056 | Could have been Vivian Iridium - what do I care?
1969 | 1399 | 1398 | He's the Maitre d', up in the First Class Restaurant. Doesn't mix with the likes of me.
1970 | 1393 | 1392 | He's the DoorBot. Not exactly someone you'd want to go clubbing with, but he's harmless enough. Normally. He's got some pretty weird mood swings at the moment.
1971 | 1397 | 1396 | He's the BarBot. Great bloke but he's a walking software failure at the moment. Got himself stuck in a very nasty loop.
1972 | 1097 | 1096 | He was a carpet salesman - 'til he fell in love with Doreen McLevity. Became a shrink to the stars, developed the Froiddroid Corporation, then died young in a tragic accident in a lobster restaurant.
1973 | 1391 | 1390 | She's the DeskBot. The chick that checked you in. And she can check me in any time.
1974 | 1395 | 1394 | He's the LiftBot. Boring old fart but who wouldn't be, stuck in a lift all day?
1975 | 1059 | 1058 | He was a great uncle of mine. Devoted his whole life to inventing the galaxy's first pocket-sized elephant tetherer. Died in poverty. There was a huge market for it but he misspelt the patent application...
1976 | 1047 | 1046 | BellBot at your service. You want it - I get it. That's my motto. Tip permitting of course.
1977 | 1051 | 1050 | On the basis of what I'm most regularly called, I'd guess my name must be "Where's-the-freakin'-BellBot". You can just call me BellBot, for short.
1978 | 1049 | 1048 | Me? I'm no-one important. I'm just the BellBot. Is there anything I can do? Fetch for you, carry for you, advise on popular tipping rates for the BellBot profession?
1979 | 1069 | 1068 | Why not?
1980 | 1071 | 1070 | Why should I tell you?
1981 | 1073 | 1072 | Why aren't the planets arranged in alphabetical order?
1982 | 1075 | 1074 | Why isn't your planet on any maps?
1983 | 1077 | 1076 | What am I - The Great Hole of Knowledge?
1984 | 1079 | 1078 | Why not try and work it out for yourself.
1985 | 1063 | 1062 | Who cares? I haven't had this much fun since I was the temperature control on a water bed...
1986 | 1081 | 1080 | Because of the Reason.
1987 | 1083 | 1082 | I can't tell you.
1988 | 1065 | 1064 | Looks to me like you got the winner in the slippy chicken contest.
1989 | 1067 | 1066 | You know, I think you might be making the mistake of relying upon me. I'm not really a Laser kind of guy, more a Bendy, Wobbly, Get-There-In-My-Own-Time type.
