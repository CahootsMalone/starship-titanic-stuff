0 | 735 | 734 | It's a nasty little sport so it is. You take thirty or forty toads with strong artistic tendencies, persuade them that the big musical is making a come-back, train them up to be a high-kicking chorus line then reveal to them that really they're going to be eaten at a theatre award ceremony. It usually ends in tears.
1 | 2039 | 2038 | Aaaah!
2 | 1841 | 1840 | Krage's all right - for a youngster who knows nothing.
3 | 1847 | 1846 | Marsinta's a cold fish and no mistake. I'd be interested to hear your opinion after you've tweaked her settings a little.
4 | 1843 | 1842 | Fentible's OK. To be honest I think his memory's going.
5 | 1845 | 1844 | Nobby's a decent enough fellow.
6 | 2085 | 2084 | Affirmative.
7 | 2041 | 2040 | Ah ha haaa!
8 | 3685 | 3684 | (air attack)
9 | 3687 | 3686 | (air attack)
10 | 2103 | 2102 | All in a day's work.
11 | 3841 | 3840 | All right, all right.
12 | 3747 | 3746 | All the time.
13 | 2057 | 2056 | Hi Krage! How're you doing?
14 | 2059 | 2058 | Hey Fentible - grab yourself a seat - relax!
15 | 2061 | 2060 | Bloody parrot!
16 | 2063 | 2062 | Off with you you pesky little creature!
17 | 2065 | 2064 | Damn parrots flying all over the shop!
18 | 2067 | 2066 | Sorry about that. Ship's full of parrots!
19 | 2099 | 2098 | Best ask the DoorBot or the BellBot. I've never been out of the Bar.
20 | 1917 | 1916 | Ah now you'll have to talk to the DoorBot about that. It's not my line.
21 | 3611 | 3610 | Ah, I'm not much cop at modern technology - you should ask the DoorBot about that.
22 | 3613 | 3612 | If there's anything else I can help you with, please hesitate to ask.
23 | 1921 | 1920 | You'll have to ask the LiftBot I'm afraid, it's not my line.
24 | 2109 | 2108 | If there's anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask.
25 | 3857 | 3856 | Astounding.
26 | 2373 | 2372 | I'm afraid until I've finished making this cocktail, the blender's unavailable.
27 | 2069 | 2068 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
28 | 2071 | 2070 | I hope you don't think I'm prying - but are you getting anywhere with that bomb?
29 | 2073 | 2072 | Don't think me rude, but shouldn't you defuse the bomb before it goes off?
30 | 2075 | 2074 | Can I remind you about the bomb?
31 | 2077 | 2076 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down. You won't forget about it will you.
32 | 2385 | 2384 | Time please! Let's be having you!
33 | 2403 | 2402 | All right then time for one last quick one!
34 | 2405 | 2404 | Where did I put that spanner?
35 | 2407 | 2406 | Look out! Midgets!
36 | 2409 | 2408 | What can I get ya?
37 | 2411 | 2410 | I don't feel well.
38 | 2413 | 2412 | It's got a fierce kick on it that Titanic Titillator!
39 | 2415 | 2414 | Happy birthday to me, happy birthday to me...
40 | 2417 | 2416 | Gone and never called me mother...
41 | 2419 | 2418 | I think I'm going to cry.
42 | 2421 | 2420 | All the little people, we love them but we never tell them.
43 | 2387 | 2386 | Goodnight ladies!
44 | 2389 | 2388 | Can anyone lend me ten bob till Friday?
45 | 2391 | 2390 | Where's my wheelbarrow?
46 | 2393 | 2392 | Last orders now. I need those glasses!
47 | 2395 | 2394 | Time Ladies and Gentlemen!
48 | 2397 | 2396 | Last Orders!
49 | 2399 | 2398 | Mind the windows!
50 | 2401 | 2400 | No fighting now!
51 | 2049 | 2048 | Ah, it's not worth bothering with.
52 | 2051 | 2050 | That's not important.
53 | 2053 | 2052 | You don't need to bother with that.
54 | 2055 | 2054 | Nothing you need to worry about.
55 | 3587 | 3586 | It's always happy hour on the Starship Titanic.
56 | 3593 | 3592 | I hope you won't think me forward - but could you give us a hand to get out of this damned loop?
57 | 3595 | 3594 | Can't you see? I'm trapped in a fiendish loop. Have been for hours. Soon as the ship's intelligence packed in it started.
58 | 3597 | 3596 | The only solution as far as I can see is to put together the damned cocktail on the menu down there. Titanic Titillator it's called. Can't say it rings any bells but even a master BarBot can't be expected to remember all the cocktails in the universe.
59 | 3599 | 3598 | Ah you're a gentleman. Now, there are some ingredients that I'll be needing which I can't find anywhere in the Bar. If you could find them for me, I'd be very grateful.
60 | 3601 | 3600 | Look, I thought you said you'd help me, but you're just standing around talking.
61 | 3529 | 3528 | Now all we need is parrot giblets.
62 | 3547 | 3546 | Fill the glass with feathers.
63 | 3549 | 3548 | See if you can find a key to unlock that menu monitor.
64 | 3585 | 3584 | What am I supposed to do with this? I said crushed ferrets giblets!, I've got lemons and TVs. Now all I need are some ferret giblets.
65 | 3531 | 3530 | Feathers would be useful I feel.
66 | 3533 | 3532 | Now we need a big stick to stir it with.
67 | 3535 | 3534 | I think the cocktail needs a chicken.
68 | 3537 | 3536 | Have you seen mustard anywhere? This cocktail needs mustard I think.
69 | 3539 | 3538 | I don't want this. Take it back.
70 | 3541 | 3540 | I said crushed parrot feathers, not TV's.
71 | 3543 | 3542 | Get me a crushed BellBot.
72 | 3545 | 3544 | Get me a napkin to wipe the glass.
73 | 3591 | 3590 | If you require service, please ring the bell.
74 | 3773 | 3772 | Sure the thing is
75 | 3791 | 3790 | It does make me feel bad to have to say this
76 | 3775 | 3774 | Well now the trouble is
77 | 3777 | 3776 | Give me the nod if I've said this before
78 | 3779 | 3778 | It sure is embarrassing
79 | 3781 | 3780 | I feel like a bit of a worb saying this
80 | 3783 | 3782 | You know, the odd thing is
81 | 3785 | 3784 | It's a funny thing but
82 | 3787 | 3786 | I know you'll think it isn't logical
83 | 3789 | 3788 | Now here's a thing I never thought I'd say
84 | 3793 | 3792 | and I know you'll never understand
85 | 3811 | 3810 | and I have to say it doesn't often happen to me
86 | 3813 | 3812 | and I have to say it's a pretty rare event for me
87 | 3795 | 3794 | and I know you'd never take it personally
88 | 3797 | 3796 | and don't you go blaming the old Titanic for it
89 | 3799 | 3798 | and I'll take it on the nose myself for it
90 | 3801 | 3800 | and don't even think about sticking it on someone
91 | 3803 | 3802 | and don't you take it personal now
92 | 3805 | 3804 | and you'd better not shout it round the ship OK?
93 | 3807 | 3806 | and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally
94 | 3809 | 3808 | and I'd say this to any of the fellas on board
95 | 3815 | 3814 | but I'm not too sure.
96 | 3817 | 3816 | but I'm not too certain.
97 | 3819 | 3818 | but I can't quite recall.
98 | 3821 | 3820 | but I'm having a wee bit of trouble remembering.
99 | 3823 | 3822 | but it's slipped the old memory.
100 | 3825 | 3824 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
101 | 3827 | 3826 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
102 | 3829 | 3828 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
103 | 3831 | 3830 | but I couldn't say with rubber-coated certainty.
104 | 2263 | 2262 | Whoops there go my Cellpoint settings!
105 | 2265 | 2264 | Whoops! There go my Cellpoint settings again!
106 | 2267 | 2266 | Whahey! Don't you just love it when your Cellpoint settings change?
107 | 2269 | 2268 | Aaaah! That's better. Got me Cellpoint settings back on course again.
108 | 2033 | 2032 | Ah there you are! Well it's a real pleasure to see you again my friend!
109 | 2035 | 2034 | Ahoy there! My but it's a breath of fresh air having you back in the bar.
110 | 3861 | 3860 | Cheer up.
111 | 3509 | 3508 | I see. I see.
112 | 3511 | 3510 | Mmmm.
113 | 3513 | 3512 | Humming.
114 | 3515 | 3514 | If there's nothing else I can do for you...?
115 | 3517 | 3516 | Would Sir/Madam/Other prefer anything else from the Bar?
116 | 3519 | 3518 | Can I get you something or are you just going to stand there all day?
117 | 1857 | 1856 | Cough.
118 | 3733 | 3732 | Could do.
119 | 3475 | 3474 | My charm level is quite low, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is low at the moment I'm afraid.
120 | 3473 | 3472 | My charm level is high, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is high at the moment - thank you for your interest.
121 | 3483 | 3482 | My charm level is high, my honesty level is high, my ability to come to the point level is low. Ha, that wiped the smile of your scabrous pock infested face didn't it.
122 | 3481 | 3480 | My charm level is low, my honesty setting is high and my ability to come to the point setting is high though it's got bugger all to do with you - you with that face like a baboon's bum in winter.
123 | 3489 | 3488 | I'm afraid only I know what my settings are. And the controls in the Sculpture Chamber of course.
124 | 3497 | 3496 | You'll have to ask her yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
125 | 3493 | 3492 | You'll have to ask him yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
126 | 3501 | 3500 | If for some reason you are not satisfied with my Cellpoint settings they may be changed using the subtle interface in the Sculpture Chamber.
127 | 3505 | 3504 | I think you'll have to fix the ship.
128 | 3479 | 3478 | My Cellpoint settings - well of course the answer there depends very much on how you define the terms high and low, I mean there are times when it seems to me I'm an absolute blackguard and I seriously wonder if I may have damaged the reputation of the bar and yet there's other times when customers tell me I've been a complete joy to be with but that's by the by isn't it so what's my settings now well I think the old charm setting's on low and also the ability to come to the point setting is on low - at least the old honesty setting is high.
129 | 3477 | 3476 | My Cellpoint settings - well of course that depends very much on how you define the terms high and low, I mean there are times when it seems to me I'm an absolute blackguard and I seriously wonder if I may have damaged the reputation of the bar and yet there are other times when customers tell me I've been a complete joy to be with but that's by the by isn't it so what's my settings now well I think my charm level is high, my honesty level is high but my ability to come to the point level appears to be rather low at the moment.
130 | 3487 | 3486 | You want to know about my Cellpoint settings do you well what the hell are you some kind of politeness inspector I tell you if you are you'll get short shrift from me in fact you'll be lucky to get an answer do you not realize I'm rushed off my feet in here still the customer's always right sod em so I'll have to tell you: my charm setting is high, my ability to come to the point setting is high and my honesty setting is high.
131 | 3485 | 3484 | Oh it's easy enough for you to ask questions isn't it but do you spare a thought for one minute for the poor sod who has to answer them and clear away the mess afterwards to you buggery I mean I shouldn't have to stand here listening to the demented outpourings of a clearly unbalanced personality such as yourself when there's no shortage of barlike tasks to be fulfilled but somebody has to do it so what was it you were asking oh yes well my charm setting is low, my honesty setting is high and my ability to come to the point setting is low so stick that in your pants and swivel on it.
132 | 3491 | 3490 | Ask away - it'll do you bugger all good. Only bot who knows my settings is me. And the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
133 | 3499 | 3498 | How the hell should I know. Go and ask her yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
134 | 3495 | 3494 | How the hell should I know. Go and ask him yourself. Or look at the controls in the Sculpture Chamber.
135 | 3503 | 3502 | So my settings aren't good enough for you? Well fine you just bugger off to the Sculpture Chamber and change them see if I care.
136 | 3507 | 3506 | Just get off your fat ass and fix the ship - I think you'll find that's the answer.
137 | 1443 | 1442 | Fortillian.
138 | 1461 | 1460 | Yes.
139 | 1641 | 1640 | When?

141 | 1645 | 1644 | Is she?
142 | 1647 | 1646 | Are they?
143 | 1649 | 1648 | Will he?
144 | 1651 | 1650 | Will she?
145 | 1653 | 1652 | Will they?
146 | 1655 | 1654 | Did he?
147 | 1657 | 1656 | Did she?
148 | 1659 | 1658 | Did they?
149 | 1463 | 1462 | No.
150 | 1661 | 1660 | Just like you.
151 | 1663 | 1662 | Just like me.
152 | 1665 | 1664 | Typical.
153 | 1667 | 1666 | It's never too late.
154 | 1669 | 1668 | Many times.
155 | 1671 | 1670 | Not much recently.
156 | 1673 | 1672 | Aah, just like the good old days.
157 | 1675 | 1674 | Not much.
158 | 1465 | 1464 | Well, maybe.
159 | 1467 | 1466 | Why?
160 | 1469 | 1468 | What for?
161 | 1471 | 1470 | Yes, I do too.
162 | 1473 | 1472 | Do you?
163 | 1475 | 1474 | That's good.
164 | 1477 | 1476 | Never heard of him.
165 | 1479 | 1478 | Never heard of her.
166 | 1445 | 1444 | I do.
167 | 1481 | 1480 | Never heard of them.
168 | 1483 | 1482 | What's one of those?
169 | 1485 | 1484 | You talk rather a lot, don't you?
170 | 1487 | 1486 | That's right.
171 | 1489 | 1488 | Me too.
172 | 1491 | 1490 | All the time.
173 | 1493 | 1492 | Whatever you say.
174 | 1495 | 1494 | I'm not sure.
175 | 1497 | 1496 | Do what?
176 | 1499 | 1498 | Not today thank you.
177 | 1447 | 1446 | I would.
178 | 1501 | 1500 | I've no idea.
179 | 1503 | 1502 | It is.
180 | 1505 | 1504 | They do.
181 | 1507 | 1506 | They are.
182 | 1509 | 1508 | Could be.
183 | 1511 | 1510 | Certainly is.
184 | 1513 | 1512 | What's the point in that?
185 | 1515 | 1514 | Oh, I get it.
186 | 1517 | 1516 | Oh, I don't know.
187 | 1519 | 1518 | Oh I love it.
188 | 1449 | 1448 | I wouldn't.
189 | 1521 | 1520 | I'm not sure about that.
190 | 1523 | 1522 | I never was much of a fan.
191 | 1525 | 1524 | They have.
192 | 1527 | 1526 | A little.
193 | 1529 | 1528 | I know.
194 | 1531 | 1530 | I should think not.
195 | 1533 | 1532 | Many times.
196 | 1535 | 1534 | Never again.
197 | 1537 | 1536 | I might.
198 | 1539 | 1538 | It might.
199 | 1451 | 1450 | Oh, yes?
200 | 1541 | 1540 | Sorry, no can do.
201 | 1543 | 1542 | Well, I'm not.
202 | 1545 | 1544 | That's good.
203 | 1547 | 1546 | Just a feeling.
204 | 1549 | 1548 | Ah, well, this won't get the baby bathed.
205 | 1551 | 1550 | Funny old world, eh?
206 | 1553 | 1552 | Takes all sorts.
207 | 1555 | 1554 | People. I love 'em.
208 | 1557 | 1556 | It's all part of the richness of life.
209 | 1559 | 1558 | I never cease to be amazed.
210 | 1453 | 1452 | Would you?
211 | 1561 | 1560 | Never touch the stuff.
212 | 1563 | 1562 | Life and soul of the party, that's me.
213 | 1565 | 1564 | Settle down, Fortillian.
214 | 1567 | 1566 | Steady, Fortillian.
215 | 1569 | 1568 | Oh, I'll have to watch me p's and q's with you alright.
216 | 1571 | 1570 | Oh, you're a fast one.
217 | 1573 | 1572 | You're a little devil, you are.
218 | 1575 | 1574 | I'm not.
219 | 1577 | 1576 | I am.
220 | 1579 | 1578 | You're not.
221 | 1455 | 1454 | Do you?
222 | 1581 | 1580 | You are.
223 | 1583 | 1582 | You will.
224 | 1585 | 1584 | Oh.
225 | 1587 | 1586 | Oh dear.
226 | 1589 | 1588 | Me too.
227 | 1591 | 1590 | Please?
228 | 1593 | 1592 | Yes, you're right.
229 | 1595 | 1594 | Isn't she?
230 | 1597 | 1596 | Isn't he?
231 | 1599 | 1598 | Aren't they?
232 | 1457 | 1456 | Will you?
233 | 1601 | 1600 | Won't they?
234 | 1603 | 1602 | Won't she?
235 | 1605 | 1604 | Won't he?
236 | 1607 | 1606 | Does he?
237 | 1609 | 1608 | Does she?
238 | 1611 | 1610 | Do they?
239 | 1613 | 1612 | Go on.
240 | 1615 | 1614 | Is that so?
241 | 1617 | 1616 | Is that right?
242 | 1619 | 1618 | My goodness.
243 | 1459 | 1458 | Are you sure?
244 | 1621 | 1620 | Oh oh.
245 | 1623 | 1622 | I see.
246 | 1625 | 1624 | No problem.
247 | 1627 | 1626 | That's right.
248 | 1629 | 1628 | Of course.
249 | 1631 | 1630 | Could be.
250 | 1633 | 1632 | Who?
251 | 1635 | 1634 | What?
252 | 1637 | 1636 | Where?
253 | 1639 | 1638 | Why?
254 | 3649 | 3648 | It's a bent pin.
255 | 3655 | 3654 | It's a spot of parrot droppings.
256 | 3647 | 3646 | It's a ferret.
257 | 3645 | 3644 | It's a fish.
258 | 3651 | 3650 | It's a small dog.
259 | 3653 | 3652 | It's a short-haired whippet.
260 | 3759 | 3758 | Brobostigon is the project manager. All nuts and bolts and no brains.
261 | 3761 | 3760 | Leovinus is - a genius. There's no other word for it.
262 | 3763 | 3762 | Scraliontis? An Accountant so I believe though I never once saw him come within a bibbit of the Bar.
263 | 1725 | 1724 | You can either sweet talk her or.
264 | 1729 | 1728 | Go up to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the knobs.
265 | 1727 | 1726 | Change her settings.
266 | 1815 | 1814 | Sure it's a funny old world.
267 | 1833 | 1832 | Happy is as happy does.
268 | 1835 | 1834 | Red sky at night, time to fix the light.
269 | 1817 | 1816 | Well I never.
270 | 1819 | 1818 | Who'd have thought it.
271 | 1821 | 1820 | Well what do I know.
272 | 1823 | 1822 | Life never ceases to surprise.
273 | 1825 | 1824 | It's a long dog for a hard road.
274 | 1827 | 1826 | It's an ill wind that smells bad.
275 | 1829 | 1828 | Many's the journey that leads back to your home.
276 | 1831 | 1830 | He who goes upwards seldom looks downward.
277 | 3633 | 3632 | Well, can't stand here chatting all day. I've got a cocktail-mixing loop to get out of.
278 | 1807 | 1806 | If it has a bar - I've been there.
279 | 1795 | 1794 | On my money? You must be kidding.
280 | 1797 | 1796 | Oh yes. Drunk everything, I have.
281 | 1799 | 1798 | Yes.
282 | 1801 | 1800 | Drunk's for amateurs.
283 | 1793 | 1792 | No. Drinking and talking that's what I do.
284 | 1851 | 1850 | No but I'm sometimes I feel like I've drunk one.
285 | 1687 | 1686 | To tell the truth there's not much I haven't seen.
286 | 1813 | 1812 | Only thing I take is a broadminded attitude.
287 | 1811 | 1810 | No. I'm a clean living Bot.
288 | 1809 | 1808 | I like what I know and that's what I stick with.
289 | 1753 | 1752 | Don't believe in 'em.
290 | 1755 | 1754 | Why do you think?
291 | 1757 | 1756 | Exactly.
292 | 1759 | 1758 | Me neither.
293 | 3667 | 3666 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's ears have heard something, the Auditory Center is the bit that thinks about what it might mean.
294 | 3671 | 3670 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. It's the bit that thinks about what all the other bits are doing.
295 | 3665 | 3664 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's nose has smelt something, the Olfactory Center is the bit that thinks about what it might be.
296 | 3669 | 3668 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. It's the bit that tells Titania's mouth what to say.
297 | 3663 | 3662 | It's a bit of Titania's brain. Once Titania's eyes have seen something, the Vision Center is the bit that thinks about what it is.
298 | 2277 | 2276 | Ah. Let's go through it step by step.
299 | 2279 | 2278 | Have you tried kicking it?
300 | 2281 | 2280 | Good cos you'll only break it. Have you checked the fuse?
301 | 2283 | 2282 | Mmm. Well if that didn't work have you tried checking the fuse?
302 | 2287 | 2286 | Well there's your answer. Change the fuse.
303 | 2285 | 2284 | You must have put the wrong fuse in. Try another one.
304 | 1739 | 1738 | Do you feel strongly about that?
305 | 1743 | 1742 | Just making conversation were you?
306 | 1741 | 1740 | Good for you. It's important to have convictions.
307 | 3661 | 3660 | That's just a figure of speech.
308 | 1837 | 1836 | Never seen a single one.
309 | 1839 | 1838 | Don't have much time for films.
310 | 2381 | 2380 | Terrific! Wonderful! Fantastic! Amazing! You've got to be careful with this stuff. Potent. Very potent. Wow! This is good stuff!
311 | 3677 | 3676 | Get a nice big fish and put it in the bucket.
312 | 2315 | 2314 | To be honest - I'd rather see that full of starling puree.
313 | 2313 | 2312 | I'd love to get you a drink. But till I fix this damned cocktail, I'm afraid I'm stuck.
314 | 2323 | 2322 | Ah, lemon. The cocktail garnish with a hint of... lemon.
315 | 3521 | 3520 | I've already got enough, thanks.
316 | 3523 | 3522 | You've already given me that.
317 | 2311 | 2310 | Very sweet of you though I'm not sure what I'll do with it.
318 | 2317 | 2316 | What's this?
319 | 2321 | 2320 | Oh. I thought it was starling puree. Not my lucky day I suppose.
320 | 2319 | 2318 | Fantastic! Well done!
321 | 1875 | 1874 | Ah well. I would if I could but I can't so I won't: I'm stuck in a loop - a cocktail preparation loop.
322 | 2325 | 2324 | I see you're no slouch when it comes to casual violence.
323 | 2329 | 2328 | Quite the little rock star, aren't we?
324 | 2383 | 2382 | There you are. One Vision Center.
325 | 1859 | 1858 | I'm glad to hear that. Normally I'd say what can I get you - but I seem to be having a little technical difficulty.
326 | 2107 | 2106 | Glad to help.
327 | 1735 | 1734 | Good reason.
328 | 1805 | 1804 | Work.
329 | 3689 | 3688 | Well now. Most stuff that goes missing turns up in the Bilge Room, so I'd start looking there if I was you.
330 | 3621 | 3620 | The great difference between something that might go wrong and something that couldn't possibly go wrong, is that when something that couldn't possibly go wrong goes wrong, it isn't possible to get at it.
331 | 1873 | 1872 | Lovely to meet you too. What can I get you?
332 | 1877 | 1876 | Great to see you again. Are you enjoying the facilities?
333 | 1881 | 1880 | Well I'm sorry to hear that. Of course, the quicker you help me out the happier we'll all be.
334 | 1879 | 1878 | Glad to hear that. Have you had any joy finding my ingredients?
335 | 2351 | 2350 | It's a Bar.
336 | 2333 | 2332 | It's a bell.
337 | 2341 | 2340 | It's the way out.
338 | 2331 | 2330 | It's a glass.
339 | 2347 | 2346 | It's the list of ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
340 | 2345 | 2344 | It's the cocktail monitor.
341 | 2353 | 2352 | It's that damn parrot again.
342 | 2343 | 2342 | It's the Pellerator.
343 | 2337 | 2336 | It's a picture.
344 | 2349 | 2348 | It's a Succ-U-Bus.
345 | 2335 | 2334 | It's a Vision Center.
346 | 2339 | 2338 | It's somebody's idea of tasteful wallpaper.
347 | 3755 | 3754 | Hardly ever.
348 | 2377 | 2376 | Fortunately I don't understand music - otherwise it would have driven me mad I'm sure.
349 | 2379 | 2378 | Fortunately I don't understand music - just as well, don't you think?
350 | 1713 | 1712 | No. Do you?
351 | 1717 | 1716 | Cuts down on smells doesn't it.
352 | 1715 | 1714 | That's nice for you.
353 | 1695 | 1694 | You hear a lot of things in a bar.
354 | 1677 | 1676 | Probably. But being a BarBot, you tend to forget more than you've ever remembered.
355 | 1745 | 1744 | Do you not think you should be helping me make the Titanic Titillator?
356 | 1747 | 1746 | Why not?
357 | 1749 | 1748 | Well you've a black heart that's all I can say.
358 | 1751 | 1750 | Well get on with it then.
359 | 1915 | 1914 | Just saw the ad in the paper.
360 | 2369 | 2368 | I don't know. It's played with the lights off.
361 | 3849 | 3848 | I like that.
362 | 1855 | 1854 | I'm fine - how about you?
363 | 2083 | 2082 | Immediately.
364 | 2299 | 2298 | I've got lemons and vodka, now find me starling puree and crushed TV.
365 | 2303 | 2302 | I've got lemons, starling puree and vodka: now all I need is crushed TV.
366 | 2301 | 2300 | I've got lemons, vodka and crushed TV: now all I need is starling puree.
367 | 2309 | 2308 | I've got starling puree: now find me crushed TV.
368 | 2305 | 2304 | I've got crushed TV, starling puree and vodka: all I need now is lemons.
369 | 2307 | 2306 | I've got crushed TV and vodka: now all I need is starling puree and lemons.
370 | 3863 | 3862 | Lemon, Starling Puree, Crushed TV and a slug of Signurian Vodka.
371 | 3853 | 3852 | Intelligent response - for a biped.
372 | 3851 | 3850 | Interesting.
373 | 2093 | 2092 | It's over there.
374 | 2091 | 2090 | It's right behind you.
375 | 2089 | 2088 | It's right here.
376 | 1885 | 1884 | Fascinating. Does it pay well?
377 | 1887 | 1886 | What about holidays - how much do you get?
378 | 1889 | 1888 | Do you enjoy it?
379 | 1891 | 1890 | That's grand. Ah well, I can't chit chat all day - I've got a cocktail to make.
380 | 1787 | 1786 | No. Do you?
381 | 1789 | 1788 | Sorry I can't help then.
382 | 1791 | 1790 | Well you won't be needing me then will you?
383 | 1785 | 1784 | Why, would they help me with this cocktail quandary?
384 | 2357 | 2356 | It's my sandwiches.
385 | 2355 | 2354 | It's a transparent parrot-sized battle-helmet.
386 | 2361 | 2360 | It's an instrument for removing peanuts from Bot's ears.
387 | 2363 | 2362 | It's a tiny angel.
388 | 2365 | 2364 | It's a bit of leather, vital for the popular game of pouch thronging.
389 | 2359 | 2358 | It's a finger protector.
390 | 1773 | 1772 | How many years does it take to solve the Titanic Titillator problem?
391 | 1775 | 1774 | Sorry, I'm being sarcastic aren't I.
392 | 1777 | 1776 | Well you deserve it. You're no fun any more.
393 | 1707 | 1706 | Can't say I have. Is it good?
394 | 1711 | 1710 | I won't bother with it then.
395 | 1709 | 1708 | You'll have to play it for me.
396 | 2371 | 2370 | Might I suggest you peruse our cocktail menu?
397 | 3845 | 3844 | Lovely.
398 | 3727 | 3726 | Maybe.
399 | 3729 | 3728 | Mmmmmm.
400 | 3735 | 3734 | Mmmm maybe.
401 | 1779 | 1778 | No, are you?
402 | 1783 | 1782 | You'll have plenty of time to help me out of this cocktail catastrophe then, won't you.
403 | 1781 | 1780 | Figures.
404 | 995 | 994 | Sure and the recipe database might have got a little bit on the extremely garbled side, but a BarBots got to mix what a BarBots got to mix.
405 | 3865 | 3864 | There's no accounting for taste, particularly the taste of a garbled cocktail menu server after a major system error.
406 | 2043 | 2042 | Mmmmm!
407 | 3679 | 3678 | We don't have any of that kind of muck on this ship.
408 | 1893 | 1892 | That's a lovely name. Did you make it up yourself?
409 | 2561 | 2560 | What a delightful name. I'm Fortillian.
410 | 2563 | 2562 | Ha ha hah hahah hahhh ah ha ha! Oh, I'm sorry. No offence.
411 | 2565 | 2564 | Never heard of you.
412 | 2567 | 2566 | A pleasure to meet you.
413 | 1897 | 1896 | How tremendously quaint. Do you want to know what my name means?
414 | 1901 | 1900 | Good - more important things to talk about eh? Cocktails for instance.
415 | 1899 | 1898 | Me too. It was a family secret - they wouldn't tell me.
416 | 1895 | 1894 | I thought so - it sounds so delightfully - amateur.
417 | 2087 | 2086 | My pleasure.
418 | 2105 | 2104 | My pleasure.
419 | 3745 | 3744 | Never.
420 | 2423 | 2422 | The goat's job is to carry messages to the outfield and to knit mufflers.
421 | 2441 | 2440 | There's the Blood Filled Gourd of course. And the Porcelain Soap Dish.
422 | 2443 | 2442 | It's only dangerous if you're injured or die.
423 | 2445 | 2444 | As long as you're warm-blooded it's open to all.
424 | 2447 | 2446 | If you lose, your supporters take you away and disembowel you. That's how you know.
425 | 2449 | 2448 | You can bet on it but punters who lose are normally rounded up as cannon fodder.
426 | 2451 | 2450 | Anything from an afternoon to a decade.
427 | 2453 | 2452 | There's my own team of course: the Blerontin Girls Weekend Fellowship. There's the Testicle Twisters of Astrakan. There's the Men With One Raised Eyebrow. There's Partick Thistle. And the dark horses - the Meringue and High Tea Company.
428 | 2455 | 2454 | They were booked to do the catering once: enjoyed the slaughter so much that they renounced fancy cakes and became professional Nib players.
429 | 2457 | 2456 | Blerontin Girls.
430 | 2459 | 2458 | The Happy Moons Home for Elderly Gentlefolk survived only eight seconds of open play in a match a few years back against the Barbarian Hordes of the Five Planet Axis.
431 | 2425 | 2424 | The goat makes the tea, knits comforters and writes stinging reviews of the game.
432 | 2461 | 2460 | No one knows.
433 | 2463 | 2462 | Insane.
434 | 2465 | 2464 | Thousands of them.
435 | 2467 | 2466 | There's no score line in Nib. Whoever's still alive on the 18th Green takes the match.
436 | 2469 | 2468 | Head count, body count - one point each. Thousand points for a goal, five thousand per hole, two tries one submission and a rubber all five points. Exquisite garotte - if proven - five thousand.
437 | 2471 | 2470 | There's the great Neville Sinkmeister. Clem Grunt. Sally May Grunt. Dixie Lee Bone. Oh, the list's endless.
438 | 2473 | 2472 | The goal.
439 | 2475 | 2474 | There is no purpose. It's a game.
440 | 2477 | 2476 | Nobody knows.
441 | 2479 | 2478 | To counter the boredom which ensued after the meaning of life had been discovered.
442 | 2427 | 2426 | The rules are secret - that's the whole point. Otherwise the mass executions wouldn't be a surprise, would they?
443 | 2481 | 2480 | Not enough room.
444 | 2483 | 2482 | Only when children stray onto the field of play.
445 | 2485 | 2484 | Only when the conflict reaches a town.
446 | 2487 | 2486 | Usually ten florints. Sometimes your life.
447 | 2489 | 2488 | They're paid in mining planets.
448 | 2491 | 2490 | All weapons - thermo nuclear is frowned upon but not illegal.
449 | 2493 | 2492 | Nobody knows.
450 | 2495 | 2494 | One to change it. A couple of thousand to put the spectators to the sword.
451 | 2497 | 2496 | Singing at Nib games is punishable by castration.
452 | 2499 | 2498 | Cameras are not allowed at nib games.
453 | 2429 | 2428 | There've been heavy losses this year. We started the season with two thousand. I think there's five teams left.
454 | 2501 | 2500 | There are no versions. Only original. Or Classic as they now call it.
455 | 2503 | 2502 | You'd need fukkin enormous pockets.
456 | 2505 | 2504 | No.
457 | 2507 | 2506 | They play it on anything.
458 | 2509 | 2508 | Are you kidding?
459 | 2511 | 2510 | That's the whole point.
460 | 2513 | 2512 | If he did he'd be dead by the end of the first bar.
461 | 2515 | 2514 | Oh yes. They don't allow nib to be advertised on cigarette packets though. Far too dangerous.
462 | 2517 | 2516 | Like Death in its Sunday Best.
463 | 2519 | 2518 | Oh yes.
464 | 2431 | 2430 | Any planet that can fulfil the surgical quota criteria.
465 | 2521 | 2520 | Normally they shake hands. Occasionally they engage in full sex.
466 | 2523 | 2522 | Changing rooms are on different planets for reasons of safety.
467 | 2525 | 2524 | Anyone who can kill but also respects fair play can participate.
468 | 2527 | 2526 | Worbs are too scared.
469 | 2529 | 2528 | She was a team mascot, once.
470 | 2531 | 2530 | Not for long.
471 | 2533 | 2532 | Never ask a Nib player his age.
472 | 2535 | 2534 | Nib comes out for no-one.
473 | 2433 | 2432 | Capability of performing 25,000 simultaneous amputations under battle conditions.
474 | 2435 | 2434 | They say it's older than Dominoes.
475 | 2437 | 2436 | The Blerontin Girls Weekend Fellowship.
476 | 2439 | 2438 | There is until there's only four teams left - then it goes knockout.
477 | 3843 | 3842 | Nice.
478 | 3707 | 3706 | No.
479 | 3725 | 3724 | No.
480 | 3737 | 3736 | No, absolutely no.
481 | 3743 | 3742 | No!
482 | 3709 | 3708 | No.
483 | 3711 | 3710 | No.
484 | 3713 | 3712 | No.
485 | 3715 | 3714 | No.
486 | 3717 | 3716 | No.
487 | 3719 | 3718 | No.
488 | 3721 | 3720 | No.
489 | 3723 | 3722 | No.
490 | 2079 | 2078 | No can do I'm afraid. I'm what they call a built-in-Bot.
491 | 3673 | 3672 | No offence.
492 | 3675 | 3674 | You're a sniveling gutbucket. No offence.
493 | 3681 | 3680 | No offence.
494 | 3753 | 3752 | Occasionally.
495 | 3751 | 3750 | Often.
496 | 3833 | 3832 | OK.
497 | 3835 | 3834 | Yes indeed.
498 | 3837 | 3836 | That's fine.
499 | 3839 | 3838 | That's OK.
500 | 2045 | 2044 | Oooh, well.
501 | 1723 | 1722 | Just you and the parrot.
502 | 2375 | 2374 | Over there, at the end of the Bar.
503 | 1765 | 1764 | No. Did you?
504 | 1769 | 1768 | Well why do you want to know?
505 | 1771 | 1770 | Fair enough. By the by, how's the solution to my cocktail problem coming along?
506 | 1767 | 1766 | Nice aren't they? So how's the solution to my Titanic Titillator coming along?
507 | 1017 | 1016 | Fascinating. Not as fascinating as a Titanic Titillator but fascinating nevertheless.
508 | 1019 | 1018 | Well that's as maybe. In the meantime there's the wee matter of TVs, starlings vodka and lemon to deal with.
509 | 1021 | 1020 | Time, my dear friend is running out. Shall we return to the matter in hand?
510 | 1025 | 1024 | Fine. You just play amongst yourselves and I'll try and get out of this loop on me own.
511 | 1023 | 1022 | Now, what else do we need to make this cocktail?
512 | 1027 | 1026 | You know, I'd rather talk about cocktails.
513 | 1029 | 1028 | I hate to remind you, but there is a bomb ticking away.
514 | 1031 | 1030 | Very interesting. But that won't get the cocktail mixed.
515 | 1117 | 1116 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
516 | 1121 | 1120 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
517 | 1125 | 1124 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
518 | 1129 | 1128 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
519 | 1133 | 1132 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
520 | 1137 | 1136 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
521 | 1185 | 1184 | Have you worked out how to get to the Bridge?
522 | 1187 | 1186 | You reach it from Titania's Room, but until she's fixed, I suspect the access is closed.
523 | 1157 | 1156 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
524 | 1141 | 1140 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
525 | 1149 | 1148 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
526 | 1145 | 1144 | Have you been using the elevators?
527 | 1153 | 1152 | Have you had a proper talk with Marsinta?
528 | 1161 | 1160 | Have you been to the Music Room yet?
529 | 1165 | 1164 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
530 | 1169 | 1168 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
531 | 1173 | 1172 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
532 | 1177 | 1176 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
533 | 1181 | 1180 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
534 | 1205 | 1204 | the First Class Restaurant?
535 | 1209 | 1208 | the First Class Staterooms?
536 | 1213 | 1212 | the Second Class Staterooms?
537 | 1217 | 1216 | the Arboretum?
538 | 1221 | 1220 | the Bilge Room?
539 | 1225 | 1224 | the Bottom of the Well?
540 | 1245 | 1244 | the Grand Axial Canal?
541 | 1229 | 1228 | the Creators Chamber?
542 | 1237 | 1236 | the Embarkation Lobby?
543 | 1233 | 1232 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
544 | 1241 | 1240 | Marsinta - have you had a chat with her yet?
545 | 1249 | 1248 | the Music Room?
546 | 1253 | 1252 | the Promenade Deck?
547 | 1257 | 1256 | the Sculpture Chamber?
548 | 1261 | 1260 | the SGT Lounge?
549 | 1265 | 1264 | the SGT Restaurant?
550 | 1269 | 1268 | Titania's Room?
551 | 1033 | 1032 | Well, it just might be worth having a wee look around the First Class Restaurant.
552 | 1037 | 1036 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
553 | 1041 | 1040 | Maybe you ought to have another look round your Second Class Stateroom.
554 | 1045 | 1044 | Why don't you see what's happening in the Arboretum?
555 | 1049 | 1048 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
556 | 1053 | 1052 | Maybe you should have another look in the Bilge Room?
557 | 1057 | 1056 | You've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
558 | 1115 | 1114 | Of course, it's the Bridge you really need to reach, but you'll have to fix Titania first to get access.
559 | 1075 | 1074 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal? There's a lot to see up there all right.
560 | 1061 | 1060 | Have you had a good look in the Creators Chamber? I hear there's some odd stuff in there all right.
561 | 1065 | 1064 | You should use the elevator a bit more - have a proper look round the ship.
562 | 1071 | 1070 | Why not visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a wee chat with Marsinta?
563 | 1079 | 1078 | Why not go up to the Music Room? Damn sight better music than the stuff they pipe in here.
564 | 1273 | 1272 | Well perhaps you should give it a go.
565 | 1275 | 1274 | Maybe you ought to check it out then.
566 | 1277 | 1276 | Given the mess I'm in here I'd be grateful if you checked it out.
567 | 1279 | 1278 | Would you mind awfully having a wee look - it'd make a BarBot eternally happy.
568 | 1083 | 1082 | Fentible was telling me there's a parrot on board. Maybe you should go check it out.
569 | 1189 | 1188 | Ah well. What about.
570 | 1193 | 1192 | I see. Well what about.
571 | 1197 | 1196 | Right. How about.
572 | 1201 | 1200 | Mmm. What about.
573 | 1087 | 1086 | You've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. You know you really should pay it a visit.
574 | 1091 | 1090 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue - but then, what do I know?
575 | 1095 | 1094 | If you didn't visit the SGT Lounge, well maybe you should go back and have another look.
576 | 1099 | 1098 | You know, I'm thinking the SGT Restaurant might hold a clue.
577 | 1103 | 1102 | Now I reckon you've missed out one of the highlights of the ship - Titania's Room.
578 | 1107 | 1106 | I know you've already been to Titania's Room but it's still worth another visit.
579 | 1111 | 1110 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get things in perspective.
580 | 1329 | 1328 | It takes you up and it takes you along.
581 | 1331 | 1330 | It has little buttons you press that take you where you want to go.
582 | 2135 | 2134 | Actors eh. What would the theatre be without them? Empty I suppose.
583 | 2137 | 2136 | Actresses. What would we do without them. What would actors do without them.
584 | 2139 | 2138 | Advertising. Oh it's a powerful tool.
585 | 2141 | 2140 | Artists eh? Paint all over the place. Inspiration. Heavy drinking. Suicide. It's no life for a grown man.
586 | 2143 | 2142 | Art. I'll tell you one thing: I know what I like and I like what I know.
587 | 2145 | 2144 | Writers eh? Solitary life. Divorces, drink, drugs, failure, highs, lows, pencil sharpeners. Ah, it's a dog's life.
588 | 2259 | 2258 | If you fix this damn loop you'd find the service a whole lot better I can tell you.
589 | 2255 | 2254 | If all the barmen in all the galaxy were gathered together... there'd be a lot of people waiting for their drinks I can tell you.
590 | 2147 | 2146 | You pay for the name don't you. Still, you can't argue with that.
591 | 2149 | 2148 | I'm not a great cheese fan. Gets stuck in the pumps.
592 | 2151 | 2150 | Ah comedians. Tears behind the clown's face, broken marriages, suicide, drink, drugs, unwelcome newspaper articles. Still if they can't take a joke they shouldn't join, that's what I say.
593 | 2153 | 2152 | Food. What would we do without it eh? Course, I don't eat it. I'm a robot.
594 | 2155 | 2154 | Cop shows. Full of mistakes: never get the Bars right.
595 | 2157 | 2156 | Crime? I blame the criminals.
596 | 2123 | 2122 | If you ask me that parrot's not all it seems - got squinty eyes it has.
597 | 2159 | 2158 | Directors eh? Huh. Big cars, casting couches, drugs, drink, suicide, broken marriages, ulcers, heart attacks. Beats working behind a bar any day.
598 | 2129 | 2128 | Fancy Feet Fortillian they used to call me - soon as we get this cocktail on the road I'll show you.
599 | 2161 | 2160 | Drugs. Take em or leave em that's what I say.
600 | 2163 | 2162 | Interesting planet you have there.
601 | 2165 | 2164 | Feelings - who needs them? People, I suppose.
602 | 2167 | 2166 | Celebrities eh? Can't live at the top for ever. Nose jobs, blackmail, photos, affairs, drugs, drink, suicide, broken marriages. Still, I hear the pay's good.
603 | 2169 | 2168 | What do you think of this little number? Pretty cool eh?
604 | 2171 | 2170 | Yes well, maybe that's enough about me for now.
605 | 2173 | 2172 | You know- an animal's not an animal unless you can make a decent cocktail twirler out of it.
606 | 2175 | 2174 | You ought to get out more. Sitting in a darkened room watching flickering lights is bad for you. Unless it's a bar of course.
607 | 2177 | 2176 | Well you know what they say: Bars and fish don't mix.
608 | 2179 | 2178 | If you like flowers you ought to head up to the Arboretum.
609 | 2181 | 2180 | You know the one thing I really miss being a Bot? Bacon sandwiches.
610 | 2183 | 2182 | I had a hobby once. I used to make tiny Bots out of matchsticks and put them in bottles. Pointless really, looking back on it.
611 | 2185 | 2184 | Sort this Titanic Titillator out and you'll be a hero to me, I can tell you.
612 | 2261 | 2260 | Personally I don't find domestic appliances that exciting.
613 | 2187 | 2186 | Know where my heart is? A little place called Blargh. On my mother's mantelpiece. In a bottle.
614 | 2189 | 2188 | TV stars eh? Illusory fame, depression, empty lives, ill-advised marriages, three in a bed romps, alcoholism, tabloid exposes. Somebody has to do it I suppose.
615 | 2191 | 2190 | Royalty eh? Just like you and me. Only they're absurdly wealthy and I'm not.
616 | 2193 | 2192 | I'll get you one just as soon as you've fixed this loop.
617 | 2195 | 2194 | Books who needs them? Bookshops I suppose.
618 | 2197 | 2196 | Don't get time for magazines in this job. Especially when you're stuck in a loop like this.
619 | 2127 | 2126 | I don't care who makes the stuff - just as long as it's got rhythm.
620 | 2125 | 2124 | Music. Where would we be without it? Actually we'd be a damned sight happier without the music in here, I can tell you. It's driving me nuts.
621 | 2199 | 2198 | I wonder if we could call in an air-strike - get rid of that damned parrot.
622 | 2201 | 2200 | I wonder if we could call in an air-strike - get rid of that damned parrot.
623 | 2203 | 2202 | You know you really ought to check out the guys in the music room - you'd love them.
624 | 2131 | 2130 | Very amusing, very nautical.
625 | 2205 | 2204 | One rule I have in my bar - no politics.
626 | 2207 | 2206 | No use talking fancy ideas to me - I'm just your average BarBot.
627 | 2209 | 2208 | Get me out of this cocktail loop and who knows - it could be your lucky day.
628 | 2211 | 2210 | If you ask me, space is over-rated. There's far more than we really need.
629 | 2213 | 2212 | Politicians - they get my vote every time.
630 | 2215 | 2214 | I could have been a rocket scientist you know. Only one thing stopped me - I haven't got a brain.
631 | 2115 | 2114 | Science. Oh it's a magical thing isn't it.
632 | 2217 | 2216 | Ah science. There's a big subject all right.
633 | 2117 | 2116 | Scientists. Now they're fellas with big brains all right.
634 | 2219 | 2218 | One good thing about being a Bot. You miss out on all the messy stuff.
635 | 2221 | 2220 | Science fiction. Don't believe in it myself.
636 | 2111 | 2110 | Slow is as slow does, and don't you forget it.
637 | 2223 | 2222 | Nothing wrong with a good soap - just as long as it doesn't eat into your drinking time.
638 | 2225 | 2224 | You go ahead and sing if it makes you happy.
639 | 2227 | 2226 | You want to talk sport - let's talk Nib.
640 | 2229 | 2228 | Hey! Cut that out!
641 | 2231 | 2230 | Now now, no swearing in the bar please.
642 | 2233 | 2232 | If you have to swear could you go into the lobby to do it. thank you.
643 | 2235 | 2234 | House rules - no swearing in the public areas please.
644 | 2237 | 2236 | Swear one more time and I shall be forced to shut down until further notice.
645 | 2119 | 2118 | D'you know, that name rings a bell. Must have been someone I knew at cocktail college.
646 | 2239 | 2238 | Course there's not a team in the galaxy could hack it playing Nib.
647 | 2113 | 2112 | You just get it out of your system - you'll feel a lot better.
648 | 2257 | 2256 | Fine. Put me out of my misery.
649 | 2121 | 2120 | Shouldn't believe everything you read in books. I read that in a paper.
650 | 2133 | 2132 | Sorry, but the TLA server is down at the moment.
651 | 2241 | 2240 | Do you know what I think would make a great toy? A little tiny BarBot on wheels. You could have it at home running round getting your drinks.
652 | 2243 | 2242 | I didn't know car planets still existed.
653 | 2245 | 2244 | You still have planes? How quaint.
654 | 2247 | 2246 | Don't get time to watch TV.
655 | 2249 | 2248 | By the way, if you get access to any weapons do feel free to have a go at the parrot.
656 | 2253 | 2252 | Course if you want to try your hand at weather forecasting - just pop up to the Arboretum.
657 | 2251 | 2250 | Talking of computers - you realize we're relying on you to put Titania back together again.
658 | 1311 | 1310 | This is the Bar.
659 | 1313 | 1312 | I'm Fortillian. I'm the BarBot.
660 | 1319 | 1318 | That's the Bell you use to get service.
661 | 1297 | 1296 | It's a Glass.
662 | 1317 | 1316 | Well, I do believe that's a Glass.
663 | 1315 | 1314 | That's the cocktail menu monitor.
664 | 1325 | 1324 | That's the Pellerator.
665 | 1327 | 1326 | It's a cross between an elevator and a travelator.
666 | 1309 | 1308 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
667 | 1305 | 1304 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
668 | 1307 | 1306 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
669 | 1299 | 1298 | Oh, you mean the bright shiny blue thing?
670 | 1301 | 1300 | That looks like Titania's Vision Center.
671 | 1303 | 1302 | It's the Vision Center.
672 | 1321 | 1320 | The bar's empty because - there's nobody in it.
673 | 1323 | 1322 | There's nobody in it - because there are no passengers. Your good self excepted of course.
674 | 3683 | 3682 | I seem to remember someone talking about the Creators Chamber in respect of passwords.
675 | 3855 | 3854 | Mmm. Perturbing.
676 | 2271 | 2270 | Anything to do with your PET - ask the DoorBot.
677 | 2273 | 2272 | Like I said - PETs are more the DoorBot's line than mine.
678 | 2275 | 2274 | PETs? I stay clear of them - you ask the DoorBot.
679 | 2625 | 2624 | Change your PET to Designer Room Number mode, and then drag the code for the room you want.
680 | 2621 | 2620 | Easy. All the rooms have chevrons to identify them. Even your stateroom. So if you know the chevron for where you want to go you can use your PET to tell an elevator or Pellerator where to take you. You can also drag chevron codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something if you want.
681 | 2623 | 2622 | Put something in the tray, use your PET to give the Succ-U-Bus the Chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. Whoever's at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops - just like that.
682 | 2627 | 2626 | Change your PET to Personal Baggage mode, and then drag whatever it is you're after straight into it.
683 | 2633 | 2632 | Don't give up now - you're the only hope we've got.
684 | 2635 | 2634 | Just switch your PET to Remote Thingummy mode. Then choose the thing you want to control, and... control it.
685 | 2631 | 2630 | Change your PET to Real Life mode and I'm sure you'll see the option you're after.
686 | 1721 | 1720 | It's the salt: it corrodes my fingers.
687 | 1719 | 1718 | Peanuts.
688 | 1761 | 1760 | Nib? You want to talk about Nib?
689 | 1763 | 1762 | How can I describe Nib. Greatest, most dangerous, awesome game ever invented.
690 | 2367 | 2366 | It's a bar game, very popular at Christmas. Quite messy.
691 | 3615 | 3614 | Advertising - just a nice name for lying, eh? Like Super Galactic Traveler Class. Ha! That's a good one.
692 | 3769 | 3768 | Well now you don't see many of those round here. What was it again?
693 | 3771 | 3770 | I thought that's what you said. Never heard of it.
694 | 1937 | 1936 | Did you find that chicken you were looking for earlier?
695 | 1955 | 1954 | You should be able to walk on the ice then.
696 | 1957 | 1956 | You know you're allowed to change the weather, don't you.
697 | 1959 | 1958 | Just fiddle with the knobs on the weather controls in the Arboretum.
698 | 1961 | 1960 | Did you sort the music out?
699 | 1963 | 1962 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
700 | 1965 | 1964 | Did you have any joy in the Bilge Room?
701 | 1967 | 1966 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
702 | 1939 | 1938 | Did you find the napkin you were looking for?
703 | 1969 | 1968 | Have you been sneezing?
704 | 1987 | 1986 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
705 | 1989 | 1988 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
706 | 1991 | 1990 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
707 | 1993 | 1992 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
708 | 1995 | 1994 | Is it true you've found a body?
709 | 1997 | 1996 | Who is it - do you know?
710 | 1999 | 1998 | The Accountant. Couldn't have happened to a nicer fella.
711 | 2001 | 2000 | The Project Manager. Did he fall in a Succ-U-Bus do you think?
712 | 2003 | 2002 | Did you search the body?
713 | 2005 | 2004 | Well don't you think you ought to?
714 | 2007 | 2006 | What did you find?
715 | 2009 | 2008 | Was there anything written on them?
716 | 1971 | 1970 | Krage was telling me he's been hearing sneezing all day.
717 | 2011 | 2010 | Far as I know all the fuse boxes are up in Titania's Room - check it out.
718 | 1973 | 1972 | Have you worked out how to change the Bot settings?
719 | 1975 | 1974 | You need some kind of a pipe or a hose.
720 | 1977 | 1976 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
721 | 1979 | 1978 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
722 | 1981 | 1980 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
723 | 1983 | 1982 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
724 | 1985 | 1984 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
725 | 1941 | 1940 | Did you get that awful chicken machine to work?
726 | 2013 | 2012 | Any luck with the lemon?
727 | 2031 | 2030 | I hear you've been taking a look at the ship's mail system. Did you find anything useful?
728 | 2037 | 2036 | Ah, I see from your PET that you've found what you were looking for.
729 | 2015 | 2014 | Any joy with the starling puree?
730 | 2017 | 2016 | Did you find a TV set?
731 | 2019 | 2018 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
732 | 2021 | 2020 | Did you have any luck with the bomb?
733 | 2023 | 2022 | Did you find that hammer you were looking for?
734 | 2025 | 2024 | Did you sort things out with the Maitre d'Bot?
735 | 2027 | 2026 | Have you met the Maitre d'Bot yet?
736 | 2029 | 2028 | Have you got yourself a First Class upgrade yet?
737 | 1943 | 1942 | Did you work out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
738 | 1945 | 1944 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
739 | 1947 | 1946 | Did you get your room changed?
740 | 1949 | 1948 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
741 | 1951 | 1950 | Is it winter or summer?
742 | 1953 | 1952 | You should be able to see what's in the trees then.
743 | 2081 | 2080 | Right away.
744 | 3757 | 3756 | When the mood's right.
745 | 3659 | 3658 | You can say that again.
746 | 1699 | 1698 | No. Have you?
747 | 1703 | 1702 | Join the club then.
748 | 1701 | 1700 | Was it good?
749 | 1693 | 1692 | Me neither.
750 | 1705 | 1704 | Now how could I do that? I'm stuck here aren't I...
751 | 3657 | 3656 | SGT stands for Super-Galactic Traveler class.
752 | 1681 | 1680 | No. Have you?
753 | 1685 | 1684 | Well that makes two of us.
754 | 1683 | 1682 | Oh, well that's nice for you.
755 | 3603 | 3602 | Achoo!
756 | 3605 | 3604 | Achoo!
757 | 3607 | 3606 | Achoo!
758 | 3609 | 3608 | Achoo!
759 | 3635 | 3634 | Call it what you like, someone's got to do it - well, it's a job that's got to be done isn't it? I'm allowed to have a hobby aren't I?
760 | 3749 | 3748 | Sometimes.
761 | 1861 | 1860 | I'm truly sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to help?
762 | 1863 | 1862 | Mmm. Actually on second thoughts there's nothing I can do anyway - I'm stuck in a loop here and have been for some time.
763 | 3625 | 3624 | So they say.
764 | 3629 | 3628 | So they tell me.
765 | 3623 | 3622 | So you say.
766 | 3627 | 3626 | So you tell me.
767 | 3847 | 3846 | Spot on.
768 | 1731 | 1730 | Have you tried changing his setting?
769 | 3631 | 3630 | I'm afraid I'm stuck in a loop here. You know how it is when you're a robot. Well, maybe you don't, but that's what it's like anyway.
770 | 2629 | 2628 | No can do I'm afraid. You can summon the BellBot and the DoorBot cos they're all over the ship. Me - I'm stuck here.
771 | 1933 | 1932 | Just as soon as you've got me out of this wretched loop.
772 | 1905 | 1904 | For one thing you don't have any bags and for another - that's really the BellBot's job not mine.
773 | 1689 | 1688 | No - even if I had I wouldn't remember.
774 | 2101 | 2100 | Thank you.
775 | 3619 | 3618 | That's as maybe.
776 | 3617 | 3616 | No, that would be telling, wouldn't it?
777 | 2097 | 2096 | This is the bar.
778 | 1697 | 1696 | Being a BarBot you don't get much time for thinking.
779 | 2537 | 2536 | Time you got a move on.
780 | 2555 | 2554 | Whenever you like.
781 | 2539 | 2538 | Never.
782 | 2541 | 2540 | Immediately.
783 | 2543 | 2542 | Right away.
784 | 2545 | 2544 | Soon.
785 | 2547 | 2546 | Later.
786 | 2549 | 2548 | Earlier.
787 | 2551 | 2550 | Just missed it.
788 | 2553 | 2552 | If you hurry you might just make it.
789 | 2557 | 2556 | Have you tried the Bar?
790 | 2559 | 2558 | Have you tried the Restaurant?
791 | 2991 | 2990 | Ahhh.
792 | 2807 | 2806 | Krage's a waste of memory.
793 | 2813 | 2812 | Marsinta's a right snob. Never been in the bar yet.
794 | 2809 | 2808 | Fentible should be on the scrap heap.
795 | 2811 | 2810 | Nobby's a right pain. Should have been recycled.
796 | 2817 | 2816 | Maitre d'Bot's a right little snob.
797 | 2815 | 2814 | RowBot drives me mad even at this distance.
798 | 2995 | 2994 | Ah ha.
799 | 3009 | 3008 | Sheee... Huh huh huh.
800 | 3023 | 3022 | Hey Krage! You're barred. Get out!
801 | 3025 | 3024 | Hey Fentible! No DoorBots - OK?
802 | 3027 | 3026 | Bloody parrot!
803 | 3029 | 3028 | Off with you, you pesky little creature!
804 | 3031 | 3030 | Damn parrots flying all over the shop! Huh!
805 | 3033 | 3032 | Ship's full of parrots! They'd better not belong to you.
806 | 2913 | 2912 | What do I care? Ask a BellBot or a DoorBot.
807 | 3357 | 3356 | Don't you just hate it when robots don't work?
808 | 3359 | 3358 | I'm beginning to annoy you aren't I? I do hope I am.
809 | 3361 | 3360 | Isn't it annoying when a robot doesn't understand you?
810 | 3325 | 3324 | Look even if I had a blender I wouldn't tell you. So shut up about blenders, OK?
811 | 3035 | 3034 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
812 | 3037 | 3036 | Are you getting anywhere with that bomb or are you just going to pretend it doesn't exist?
813 | 3039 | 3038 | If you don't defuse that bomb soon you're going to blow us all up.
814 | 3041 | 3040 | Can I remind you about the bomb - or are you just too stupid to care?
815 | 3043 | 3042 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down. But what do you care?
816 | 3015 | 3014 | Nothing worth bothering your little mind with.
817 | 3017 | 3016 | That's not important.
818 | 3019 | 3018 | You don't need to bother with that.
819 | 3021 | 3020 | Nothing you need to worry about.
820 | 3343 | 3342 | Sorry, can't help.
821 | 997 | 996 | Why bring that up now? Because you're an idiot I suppose.
822 | 999 | 998 | What is the point of bringing that up now? You're useless - what are you?
823 | 1001 | 1000 | You said it.
824 | 1003 | 1002 | Well aren't we a bit of a smartass today.
825 | 1005 | 1004 | You are beginning to bore me my friend. Get off your backside and do something useful.
826 | 1007 | 1006 | While you're here gassing like a drunken donkey there's a bomb needs dealing with. Or did you forget it already?
827 | 1009 | 1008 | Well do something about it.
828 | 1011 | 1010 | Do you WANT to blow us up?
829 | 1015 | 1014 | Well you're going the wrong way about it.
830 | 1013 | 1012 | Well don't expect any help from me.
831 | 2887 | 2886 | Damn these Cellpoint settings - will they not stay still for a moment?
832 | 2889 | 2888 | Dammit! My settings have changed again.
833 | 2891 | 2890 | Aaghh! There go me Cellpoint settings.
834 | 3273 | 3272 | Correct.
835 | 3453 | 3452 | Bantoburn.
836 | 3455 | 3454 | O'Perfluous.
837 | 3011 | 3010 | Ah... Dear oh dear.
838 | 2685 | 2684 | You could try saying something intelligent or.
839 | 2689 | 2688 | Go figure it out for yourself - I'm not going to help you.
840 | 2687 | 2686 | Change her settings.
841 | 2793 | 2792 | You never cease to amaze me.
842 | 2795 | 2794 | What do you mean?
843 | 2797 | 2796 | You come out with the most staggering inanities.
844 | 2799 | 2798 | Hey fellas! It's the walking encyclopaedia again.
845 | 3691 | 3690 | If I wasn't stuck in this loop I'd come round that bar and stick this bell where the sun doesn't shine - OK?
846 | 3693 | 3692 | If you keep doing that you'll break it.
847 | 3695 | 3694 | Brilliant. You've broken it. Ruined it for everyone. You're an eejit aren't you. A right eejit.
848 | 3375 | 3374 | Earlier.
849 | 2775 | 2774 | Not telling.
850 | 2777 | 2776 | I don't like you.
851 | 2779 | 2778 | You keep asking the same dumb questions.
852 | 2763 | 2762 | What I buy or don't buy is my business.
853 | 2765 | 2764 | Oh yes. Drink everything, I do.
854 | 2767 | 2766 | Yes.
855 | 2769 | 2768 | Drunk's for failures.
856 | 2753 | 2752 | No. Reading gets in the way of drinking and being rude.
857 | 2821 | 2820 | No but I'm sure you're going to tell me you have.
858 | 2647 | 2646 | None of your business.
859 | 2791 | 2790 | No but with you in the Bar I'm tempted to start.
860 | 2783 | 2782 | I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that I might incriminate myself.
861 | 2785 | 2784 | Are you thick as well as ugly?
862 | 2789 | 2788 | You can only lie to yourself for so long.
863 | 2787 | 2786 | At least you're honest.
864 | 2781 | 2780 | If I had I wouldn't tell you.
865 | 2703 | 2702 | No.
866 | 2705 | 2704 | Why do you think?
867 | 2707 | 2706 | Maybe, maybe not.
868 | 2709 | 2708 | Me neither.
869 | 3237 | 3236 | What do you take me for - the maintenance engineer? Fix it.
870 | 3239 | 3238 | I don't know. Kick it. Change the fuse. You'll think of something.
871 | 2801 | 2800 | I don't give a fig.
872 | 2803 | 2802 | Who gives a hoot?
873 | 2805 | 2804 | You're not important.
874 | 3331 | 3330 | Of course it's highly unlikely you got the ingredients right.
875 | 3333 | 3332 | I'll just add a splash of Signurian Vodka.
876 | 3063 | 3062 | Find it yourself.
877 | 3013 | 3012 | Foof!
878 | 3257 | 3256 | To be honest - I'd rather see that full of starling puree.
879 | 3259 | 3258 | Because I need it for the Titanic Titillator.
880 | 3255 | 3254 | Here. Take this. Fill it full of starling puree. Bring it back. What could be easier.
881 | 3267 | 3266 | Astonishing. You've managed to do something right.
882 | 3251 | 3250 | What am I supposed to do with this you cretin?
883 | 3253 | 3252 | Dear oh dear oh dear. Lemons. TV's. Puree. Got it?
884 | 3261 | 3260 | What's this muck you've brought me?
885 | 3265 | 3264 | Mmm. Could be. Could be starling puree though. Worth a try.
886 | 3263 | 3262 | Some hope. Still, it's worth a try.
887 | 3269 | 3268 | Crushed television. I didn't think you had the brains to get it.
888 | 3335 | 3334 | Take it. Now bugger off.
889 | 2773 | 2772 | Avoiding you.
890 | 2823 | 2822 | Well wonders will never cease. What do you want?
891 | 2825 | 2824 | How you got an upgrade beats me. Are you going to help me now?
892 | 2827 | 2826 | Have you got anything for me?
893 | 2829 | 2828 | I know it's unlikely, but have you had any luck with the missing elements for the Titillator?
894 | 2831 | 2830 | Terrific. I'm going to be mixing this drink well into eternity.
895 | 2833 | 2832 | Brilliant. If the bomb doesn't get me the boredom will.
896 | 2835 | 2834 | I'll believe it when I see it. Show me what you've got.
897 | 3003 | 3002 | Ha!
898 | 3065 | 3064 | Hah!
899 | 3589 | 3588 | Happy hour finished the moment I saw your face you miserable little toerag.
900 | 3329 | 3328 | Fortunately your opinion counts for nothing in here sunshine.
901 | 2673 | 2672 | No. Do you?
902 | 2677 | 2676 | You'll have no-one to blame the droppings on then.
903 | 2675 | 2674 | I'm sure you're made for each other.
904 | 2655 | 2654 | Gossip's more your line.
905 | 2637 | 2636 | Maybe. What's it to you?
906 | 2759 | 2758 | Why should I? You're the pits.
907 | 2761 | 2760 | I'll only help you when my Cellpoint setting is changed. It's not my fault. Dipstick.
908 | 1119 | 1118 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
909 | 1123 | 1122 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
910 | 1127 | 1126 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
911 | 1131 | 1130 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
912 | 1135 | 1134 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
913 | 1139 | 1138 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
914 | 1159 | 1158 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
915 | 1143 | 1142 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
916 | 1151 | 1150 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
917 | 1147 | 1146 | Have you been using the elevators?
918 | 1155 | 1154 | Have you bored the ass off Marsinta yet?
919 | 1163 | 1162 | Have you been up to the Music Room yet?
920 | 1167 | 1166 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
921 | 1171 | 1170 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
922 | 1175 | 1174 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
923 | 1179 | 1178 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
924 | 1183 | 1182 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
925 | 1207 | 1206 | the First Class Restaurant?
926 | 1211 | 1210 | the First Class Staterooms?
927 | 1215 | 1214 | the Second Class Staterooms?
928 | 1219 | 1218 | the Arboretum?
929 | 1223 | 1222 | the Bilge Room?
930 | 1227 | 1226 | the Bottom of the Well?
931 | 1247 | 1246 | the Grand Axial Canal?
932 | 1231 | 1230 | the Creators Chamber?
933 | 1239 | 1238 | the Embarkation Lobby?
934 | 1235 | 1234 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
935 | 1243 | 1242 | Marsinta - have you pestered her yet?
936 | 1251 | 1250 | the Music Room?
937 | 1255 | 1254 | the Promenade Deck?
938 | 1259 | 1258 | the Sculpture Chamber?
939 | 1263 | 1262 | the SGT Lounge?
940 | 1267 | 1266 | the SGT Restaurant?
941 | 1271 | 1270 | Titania's Room?
942 | 1035 | 1034 | I don't believe the First Class Restaurant has had the pleasure yet of seeing your fat spotty face.
943 | 1039 | 1038 | Since you conned your way into First Class maybe you should check out the Staterooms.
944 | 1043 | 1042 | You're a second class person so why not check out your Second Class Stateroom.
945 | 1047 | 1046 | Take a trip to the Arboretum. You're as thick as two short planks - you'd like it there.
946 | 1051 | 1050 | Take a trip to the Bilge Room. You'd like it there - you certainly talk enough of it.
947 | 1055 | 1054 | Go back to the Bilge Room - it's your kind of place.
948 | 1059 | 1058 | Check out the Bottom of the Well. You'd like it there - you can't get much lower.
949 | 1077 | 1076 | Go up to the Grand Axial Canal. With a bit of luck you'll fall in.
950 | 1063 | 1062 | Take a look at the Creators Chamber. It's a weird place. You'd be at home there all right.
951 | 1067 | 1066 | Take a ride in the elevator. See how the other half live.
952 | 1073 | 1072 | Why don't you go down to the Embarkation Lobby and bore Marsinta for a change?
953 | 1081 | 1080 | Go and bore the guys in the Music Room. Why should it just be me that has to suffer?
954 | 1281 | 1280 | Well why don't you get off your fat ass and go there?
955 | 1283 | 1282 | Well go on then you daft beggar - go and have a look.
956 | 1285 | 1284 | Well what are you waiting for?
957 | 1287 | 1286 | Terrific. I'll go and polish me glass then.
958 | 1289 | 1288 | Do you not think now's a good time to do it?
959 | 1293 | 1292 | Fine. Sit and stew. What do I care.
960 | 1291 | 1290 | Well what are you waiting for. Bog off.
961 | 1295 | 1294 | Look. It's your job to get the ship going, not hang around in bars. I can do that on my own thank you very much.
962 | 1085 | 1084 | Fentible was telling me there's a parrot on board. Check it out - you and a parrot should have lots in common.
963 | 1069 | 1068 | Take a ride in the Pellerator. All you have to do is press a button - you should be able to manage that.
964 | 1191 | 1190 | I'm only asking. How about.
965 | 1195 | 1194 | Proper little boy scout aren't we. What about.
966 | 1199 | 1198 | Pardon me for taking an interest. What about.
967 | 1203 | 1202 | Been sticking your nose in everywhere I see. How about.
968 | 1089 | 1088 | Oh, you've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. Who knows, you might slip and fall into the fan.
969 | 1093 | 1092 | You ought to visit the Sculpture Chamber - not that I expect you to understand art of course.
970 | 1097 | 1096 | Why not go back to the SGT Lounge. I'm sure you'll feel more at ease in third class.
971 | 1101 | 1100 | Well, I'm not sure you checked out the SGT Restaurant properly. You were probably too busy guzzling food.
972 | 1105 | 1104 | You ought to go to Titania's Room. It's way too classy for you, I know, but you still ought to go.
973 | 1109 | 1108 | Go back to Titania's Room. You were probably too overwhelmed to take it all in the first time.
974 | 1113 | 1112 | Head up to the Top of the Well - quite a treat for a primitive life form.
975 | 1429 | 1428 | Well you came here in it - can't you work it out for yourself.
976 | 1431 | 1430 | It takes you up and it takes you along.
977 | 1433 | 1432 | It has little buttons you press that take you where you want to go.
978 | 2837 | 2836 | Lousy, as usual. How are you?
979 | 2845 | 2844 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my crushed TV set?
980 | 2847 | 2846 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my lemons?
981 | 2849 | 2848 | Let's change the subject shall we? Where are you going to get my starling puree?
982 | 2841 | 2840 | Good, I'm glad to hear you're suffering. Course we'd all feel better if you got this cocktail fixed.
983 | 2843 | 2842 | Yes, it still cheers me to think of that.
984 | 2839 | 2838 | I'm sorry to hear that.
985 | 3457 | 3456 | Don't ask me. Even if I knew, I don't feel like telling you.
986 | 2907 | 2906 | What's it to you?
987 | 3001 | 3000 | Huh.
988 | 3379 | 3378 | If you hurry you might just make it - unfortunately.
989 | 3353 | 3352 | No I'm a hamster. Course I'm a robot you eejit.
990 | 3367 | 3366 | Immediately.
991 | 1333 | 1332 | Birdbrain.
992 | 1351 | 1350 | Toolhead.

998 | 1363 | 1362 | You great palooka.
999 | 1365 | 1364 | You fat ninny.
1000 | 1367 | 1366 | You big pudge.
1001 | 1369 | 1368 | You great tub of lard.
1002 | 1335 | 1334 | Lumphead.
1003 | 1371 | 1370 | You big arse-pimple you.
1004 | 1373 | 1372 | Pumpkin-head.
1005 | 1375 | 1374 | Clod brains.
1006 | 1377 | 1376 | Cement head.

1010 | 1385 | 1384 | Meatface.
1011 | 1387 | 1386 | Fishface.
1012 | 1389 | 1388 | You great simp.
1013 | 1337 | 1336 | Lardface.
1014 | 1391 | 1390 | You big bottom grub.

1018 | 1339 | 1338 | You great dunderhead.
1019 | 1341 | 1340 | You fat mutt.
1020 | 1343 | 1342 | You big grubber.
1021 | 1345 | 1344 | Hog face.
1022 | 1347 | 1346 | Mule head.
1023 | 1349 | 1348 | Donkey-brain.
1024 | 1435 | 1434 | Hey fat face, I was talking!
1025 | 1437 | 1436 | Just butt in why don't you - what do I care?
1026 | 1439 | 1438 | Oh fine. Don't mind me - you just interrupt whenever your glands tell you to.
1027 | 1441 | 1440 | Hey dog-brain - do you have to keep interrupting?
1028 | 2993 | 2992 | I see.
1029 | 2997 | 2996 | Uh huh... I see...
1030 | 3059 | 3058 | It's over there.
1031 | 3057 | 3056 | It's right behind you.
1032 | 3055 | 3054 | It's right here.
1033 | 2871 | 2870 | Fascinating. Does someone pay you to do that?
1034 | 2873 | 2872 | What about holidays. Do they let you out?
1035 | 2875 | 2874 | Do you enjoy it?
1036 | 2877 | 2876 | That's nice. Actually I'm not at all interested in your pathetic life. I just wanted to dupe you into believing I was. Ha.
1037 | 3377 | 3376 | You just missed it. Ha.
1038 | 2741 | 2740 | No. Do you?
1039 | 2743 | 2742 | Let's keep it that way.
1040 | 2745 | 2744 | So why bother me?
1041 | 2747 | 2746 | Anyone ever tell you how boring you are?
1042 | 2751 | 2750 | You get the friends you deserve I guess.
1043 | 2749 | 2748 | Least you've got honest friends.
1044 | 2739 | 2738 | Only member I know is you.
1045 | 3373 | 3372 | Later.
1046 | 3387 | 3386 | Ha ha ha!
1047 | 3389 | 3388 | Ha ha ha!
1048 | 3391 | 3390 | Ha ha ha!
1049 | 3393 | 3392 | Ha ha ha!
1050 | 3551 | 3550 | Right. Now get me parrot giblets and be quick about it.
1051 | 3569 | 3568 | I don't want to listen to your excuses. Get me what I want, get it right and get it now.
1052 | 3571 | 3570 | Shut up with your pathetic excuses. I'm not interested.
1053 | 3573 | 3572 | Fill the glass with feathers.
1054 | 3575 | 3574 | Well go and get some. Now.
1055 | 3577 | 3576 | Go and get a key. I want to unlock that menu monitor.
1056 | 3553 | 3552 | I need feathers you great lummock. Get me feathers.
1057 | 3555 | 3554 | A big stick that's what we need. Go and find one.
1058 | 3557 | 3556 | I need chicken in this cocktail. Surely you've seen chicken somewhere, the ship's full of them.
1059 | 3559 | 3558 | Haven't you seen mustard anywhere? This cocktail needs mustard and it needs it fast.
1060 | 3561 | 3560 | I don't want this. It's crap. Take it back.
1061 | 3563 | 3562 | I said crushed parrot feathers, not TV's. You're just an excuse for a dog's rear end, that's what you are.
1062 | 3565 | 3564 | Get me a crushed BellBot and get it quick. Don't hang about.
1063 | 3567 | 3566 | Get me a napkin to wipe this glass - it's filthy and it's your fault.
1064 | 2727 | 2726 | How many idiots like you will it take to solve the Titanic Titillator problem?
1065 | 2729 | 2728 | Sorry, I'm being sarcastic aren't I.
1066 | 2731 | 2730 | Well guess what. I don't care what you feel.
1067 | 2667 | 2666 | Is it good?
1068 | 2671 | 2670 | Then why bore me asking about it.
1069 | 2669 | 2668 | Then go and play it and don't bother me.
1070 | 3323 | 3322 | Bog off will you, I'm busy.
1071 | 3347 | 3346 | You're lower class without a doubt - whatever your PET tells you.
1072 | 2923 | 2922 | Maitre D'Bot doesn't move from the 1st Class Restaurant.
1073 | 2733 | 2732 | No, are you?
1074 | 2737 | 2736 | Jeez you do ask some dumbass questions.
1075 | 2735 | 2734 | Figures.
1076 | 3005 | 3004 | Mmmmm...
1077 | 2879 | 2878 | What an odd name. Did you make it up yourself?
1078 | 2883 | 2882 | Well it suits you.
1079 | 2881 | 2880 | I thought so - it's idiotic enough.
1080 | 3067 | 3066 | You've been taught some manners then.
1081 | 3069 | 3068 | Trying to suck up to me now are we.
1082 | 3071 | 3070 | Crawling's not going to help.
1083 | 3047 | 3046 | Not if I can help it.
1084 | 3049 | 3048 | Not in a quonth of Flatterdays.
1085 | 3051 | 3050 | Negative.
1086 | 3365 | 3364 | Never.
1087 | 2859 | 2858 | You sniveling, ingratiating toad-like little slime-ball. What can I get you?
1088 | 2861 | 2860 | I was kidding. I can't get you anything. I'm stuck in a loop.
1089 | 2863 | 2862 | The pleasure's all yours. Are you having a lovely time?
1090 | 2867 | 2866 | I'm pleased to hear that. I hate suffering alone.
1091 | 2865 | 2864 | Shame. As for me well I'm still in a mess - but what do you care.
1092 | 3045 | 3044 | Look. I'm a BarBot, not some kind of servant.
1093 | 3351 | 3350 | This isn't a game.
1094 | 3345 | 3344 | None of your damned business.
1095 | 3349 | 3348 | I'm going nowhere.
1096 | 3341 | 3340 | Course I do.
1097 | 2999 | 2998 | Oh...
1098 | 2683 | 2682 | Just you and the parrot.
1099 | 3327 | 3326 | Down there at the end of the bar are you BLIND AS WELL AS STUPID?
1100 | 2719 | 2718 | No. Did you?
1101 | 2723 | 2722 | Well why do you want to know?
1102 | 2725 | 2724 | Mmm. Here's an idea - why not go bore someone else for a change?
1103 | 2721 | 2720 | How fascinating for you.
1104 | 3461 | 3460 | How should I know? I'm the friggin BarBot not the maintenance man.
1105 | 3459 | 3458 | Ask a Bot will you? I'm busy here.
1106 | 3463 | 3462 | Look I'm a top of the range BarBot - don't ask me all this crap.
1107 | 3469 | 3468 | No, you've completely lost me there.
1108 | 3465 | 3464 | You say - I'd like a drink please.
1109 | 3467 | 3466 | Now you're just talking gibberish...
1110 | 2681 | 2680 | You're a pain in the butt.
1111 | 2679 | 2678 | You.
1112 | 2711 | 2710 | Nib? You want to talk about Nib?
1113 | 2713 | 2712 | Well I've got to be in a good mood to talk about Nib.
1114 | 2715 | 2714 | Change my settings.
1115 | 2717 | 2716 | Normally I wouldn't tell you. But I like talking about Nib. Go to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the levers.
1116 | 3103 | 3102 | Actors eh? What are they? Just barmen without the cocktail skills.
1117 | 3105 | 3104 | Actresses. Ha! If you laid all the actresses I've had in my Bar end to end... then again, maybe not.
1118 | 3107 | 3106 | Advertising. Oh it's a powerful tool. Whereas you - you're just a tool.
1119 | 3109 | 3108 | While you're faffing about talking art you could be getting this cocktail sorted.
1120 | 3111 | 3110 | Right now I don't give a flying fig about art. I want my lemons. I want my TV sets. I want my puree. And I want them now.
1121 | 3113 | 3112 | You and writers have got one thing in common - you're a waste of a good life.
1122 | 3233 | 3232 | Sooner you help, sooner I can get back to work. Even to a moron like you that should be obvious.
1123 | 3229 | 3228 | Frankly I'm not interested in other bars. I just want this one fixed.
1124 | 3115 | 3114 | Any time I want to know about brand names on your pathetic planet I'll ask.
1125 | 3117 | 3116 | Only cheesy thing round here's your dumbass attempts to get the ship working again.
1126 | 3119 | 3118 | Right now I'm not interested in comedy. I'm interested in solutions.
1127 | 3121 | 3120 | Who can think of food at a time like this? I need help, not food.
1128 | 3123 | 3122 | A cop would be a damn sight more use than you - but where are they just when you need one?
1129 | 3125 | 3124 | Only crime's been committed round here is letting you on board the ship.
1130 | 3091 | 3090 | Only conspiracy I know is the one that put you in charge of sorting out this cocktail.
1131 | 3127 | 3126 | Why don't you get off your butt and do something instead of just hanging round my bar talking movies.
1132 | 3097 | 3096 | I don't want to dance! I want lemons! I want tv sets! I want puree! And I want it now!
1133 | 3129 | 3128 | Any drugs you know that will make you more intelligent - take them 'cos your performance so far is way below average.
1134 | 3131 | 3130 | I don't want geography, I want results - OK?
1135 | 3133 | 3132 | If we're going to talk feelings - how do you think I feel, stuck in this loop like a mouse in a wheel.
1136 | 3135 | 3134 | I'm more interested in getting this loop fixed than talking tittle tattle.
1137 | 3137 | 3136 | Right now I don't give a flying frog about fashion.
1138 | 3139 | 3138 | You know, a trained monkey - even a little dog - would have been more help than you.
1139 | 3141 | 3140 | Let's talk cocktails shall we, not movies.
1140 | 3143 | 3142 | Fish? I don't want to talk to you about fish. I want to talk Titanic Titillator.
1141 | 3145 | 3144 | I just want to say one thing to that. Lemons.
1142 | 3147 | 3146 | Drinks is more my specialty. Don't confuse the issue with food.
1143 | 3149 | 3148 | This is no time for chit chat about hobbies. There's a job to do.
1144 | 3151 | 3150 | When Fentible said he'd found someone who was going to help I imagined some kind of superhero. I didn't expect a bozo like you.
1145 | 3153 | 3152 | That was fiction. This is for real and you've got a job to do buttbrain.
1146 | 3235 | 3234 | Has it sunk this low? I'm talking domestic appliances to a jerk from another planet.
1147 | 3155 | 3154 | Nobody's going home till you've fixed the ship - so get on with it will you.
1148 | 3157 | 3156 | There's more to life than TV. Talking of TV's - WHERE'S MINE?
1149 | 3159 | 3158 | Instead of gossiping about royalty - aren't you forgetting there's a job to do?
1150 | 3161 | 3160 | I'd like to be able to fix some drinks. But until some dumbass gets me out of this loop I can't.
1151 | 3163 | 3162 | Who's got time to read? You don't - you've got a job to do.
1152 | 3165 | 3164 | Come on, think. You must have more interesting things to say than that.
1153 | 3095 | 3094 | Don't talk music to me - the stuff they play in here is driving me mad as it is.
1154 | 3093 | 3092 | Instead of all this blathering about musical instruments how about giving me a hand?
1155 | 3167 | 3166 | Maybe Fentible should have got someone on board with a bit of military training. Would have been more use than you.
1156 | 3169 | 3168 | Talking of musicians. Why don't you give me a break and go up to the music room?
1157 | 3099 | 3098 | Very funny. Very nautical.
1158 | 3171 | 3170 | Don't give me politics. I want action. Get off your butt and DO something.
1159 | 3173 | 3172 | Don't waste my time with theory. Get me solutions.
1160 | 3175 | 3174 | You have got to be kidding. I draw the line at ugly and you passed through there a long time ago.
1161 | 3177 | 3176 | You want to see space go on a tour. You're only on board cos there's a job to do.
1162 | 3179 | 3178 | What use would a politician be? We've got a REAL problem to solve here.
1163 | 3181 | 3180 | Forget the history of space. If you don't get off your butt we're going to be history IN space.
1164 | 3077 | 3076 | What use is science? We've had it for millions of years - and have they come up with a hangover cure? No.
1165 | 3183 | 3182 | The only science I care about is the science of making a Titanic Titillator. Get on with it.
1166 | 3079 | 3078 | Talking of scientists. You ever meet one who offers you a brain transplant, I'd take it if I were you.
1167 | 3185 | 3184 | You disgust me. If I didn't need your help I'd have had Fentible throw you out on your ass.
1168 | 3187 | 3186 | I'll pretend I didn't hear that. In fact I'll even pretend I didn't understand it. But you are one foul creature all right.
1169 | 3189 | 3188 | Science fiction. Mmm. Only an idiot like you would believe in it.
1170 | 3073 | 3072 | When are you going to get off your ass and fix my cocktail?
1171 | 3191 | 3190 | How you waste your time is of no interest to me. I just want this loop fixed.
1172 | 3193 | 3192 | Please, spare my ears. No singing.
1173 | 3195 | 3194 | That's not a sport. There's only one sport. Nib.
1174 | 3197 | 3196 | Hey! Cut that out you foul-mouthed piece of scum.
1175 | 3199 | 3198 | No swearing in the bar or I'll have you thrown out.
1176 | 3201 | 3200 | No swearing in the public areas please.
1177 | 3203 | 3202 | Hey scumbag. No swearing or else...
1178 | 3205 | 3204 | You'll find yourself down in the bilge room.
1179 | 3207 | 3206 | Right, I won't give you another warning about swearing.
1180 | 3209 | 3208 | Right. That's it. You're bilged.
1181 | 3211 | 3210 | Swear one more time and I shall be forced to shut down until further notice.
1182 | 3081 | 3080 | I knew a fella of that name at cocktail college. Nasty little tyke he was.
1183 | 3083 | 3082 | I used to know somebody of that name. Had a terrible body odor problem.
1184 | 3085 | 3084 | Mmm. Name rings a bell. Bit of a jerk if I remember rightly.
1185 | 3087 | 3086 | I know that name. Ah yes I remember - real fashion victim.
1186 | 3213 | 3212 | Whatever they play it's a wuss game compared to the real thing - Nib.
1187 | 3075 | 3074 | How's this for a threat? Finish the cocktail or I'll get the parrot in here.
1188 | 3231 | 3230 | Do what you like. I doubt you 'll be able to do anything till this loop's broken.
1189 | 3089 | 3088 | Only good book's a cocktail book.
1190 | 3101 | 3100 | Proper whizz with those TLA's aren't you? Shame you're not as bright when it comes to fixing cocktails.
1191 | 3215 | 3214 | My god it's come to this. I'm talking toys to a freak from a dirt planet.
1192 | 3217 | 3216 | Talking of transport why don't you get in that Pellerator and go and do something useful for a change.
1193 | 3219 | 3218 | Instead of jabbering on about planes - why not give me some help?
1194 | 3221 | 3220 | The only TV interests me is a crushed one.
1195 | 3223 | 3222 | What I'd give for a weapon I could use on you right now.
1196 | 3227 | 3226 | The ship's out of control in hyperspace and you want to talk about the weather. What a useless creature you are.
1197 | 3225 | 3224 | You understand computers? With your brain?
1198 | 3471 | 3470 | I don't know stuff like that. Ask the BellBot or the DoorBot.
1199 | 2929 | 2928 | Did you find the chicken?
1200 | 2945 | 2944 | Did you sort the music out?
1201 | 2947 | 2946 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
1202 | 2949 | 2948 | Did you find anything in the Bilge Room?
1203 | 2951 | 2950 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
1204 | 2931 | 2930 | Did you find the napkin?
1205 | 2953 | 2952 | Have you been sneezing?
1206 | 2969 | 2968 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
1207 | 2971 | 2970 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
1208 | 2973 | 2972 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
1209 | 2975 | 2974 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
1210 | 2977 | 2976 | Is it true you've found a body?
1211 | 2957 | 2956 | Somebody is. I heard it.
1212 | 2955 | 2954 | Well don't.
1213 | 2959 | 2958 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
1214 | 2961 | 2960 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
1215 | 2963 | 2962 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
1216 | 2965 | 2964 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
1217 | 2967 | 2966 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
1218 | 2933 | 2932 | Did you get that damned chicken machine to work?
1219 | 2979 | 2978 | What about my lemon. Have you got it yet?
1220 | 2981 | 2980 | Where's my starling puree?
1221 | 2983 | 2982 | Did you find a TV set? Get a move on.
1222 | 2985 | 2984 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
1223 | 2987 | 2986 | Have you got that bomb defused yet?
1224 | 2935 | 2934 | Did you find out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
1225 | 2937 | 2936 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
1226 | 2939 | 2938 | Did you get your room changed?
1227 | 2941 | 2940 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
1228 | 2943 | 2942 | Is it winter or summer?
1229 | 3369 | 3368 | Right away.
1230 | 2659 | 2658 | No. Have you?
1231 | 2663 | 2662 | Why ask me then?
1232 | 2661 | 2660 | I'm so happy for you.
1233 | 2653 | 2652 | Yea, well you're not very bright are you.
1234 | 2665 | 2664 | All I see is your fat face and that's a fact.
1235 | 2641 | 2640 | No. Have you?
1236 | 2645 | 2644 | Well maybe I will then.
1237 | 2643 | 2642 | Well I'm glad I didn't.
1238 | 3371 | 3370 | Soon as I'm ready.
1239 | 3355 | 3354 | So you should be.
1240 | 2695 | 2694 | Have you tried changing his setting?
1241 | 2693 | 2692 | If my Cellpoint was set at pleasant I'd tell you, but it isn't so I won't.
1242 | 2697 | 2696 | Work it out - I'm not your nanny.
1243 | 3053 | 3052 | I suppose so.
1244 | 2925 | 2924 | Find it yourself.
1245 | 2893 | 2892 | Don't talk to me like that. Who do you think I am?
1246 | 2895 | 2894 | Right. And don't you forget it.
1247 | 2897 | 2896 | Proper comedian aren't we.
1248 | 2649 | 2648 | That's my business - all right?
1249 | 3061 | 3060 | This is the Bar mutton brain.
1250 | 2657 | 2656 | I don't get much time to think with you jabbering on all day long.
1251 | 3007 | 3006 | Tschk!
1252 | 2771 | 2770 | No - I like tv even less than I like you.
1253 | 2851 | 2850 | You like weather?
1254 | 3403 | 3402 | I think you're confusing me with somebody who gives a fig.
1255 | 2857 | 2856 | Oh I see. That was your pathetic attempt at making conversation.
1256 | 2853 | 2852 | Well why not bog off to the Arboretum.
1257 | 2855 | 2854 | They've got plenty of weather there.
1258 | 1413 | 1412 | This is the Bar.
1259 | 1415 | 1414 | I'm Fortillian. I'm the BarBot.
1260 | 1419 | 1418 | That's the Bell you use to get service.
1261 | 1399 | 1398 | It's a Glass.
1262 | 1417 | 1416 | That's a Glass.
1263 | 3337 | 3336 | Do you know nothing? It's an elevator that goes sideways.
1264 | 1425 | 1424 | That's the Pellerator.
1265 | 1427 | 1426 | It's a cross between an elevator and a travelator.
1266 | 1411 | 1410 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
1267 | 1407 | 1406 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
1268 | 1409 | 1408 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
1269 | 3301 | 3300 | Got any other stupid questions?
1270 | 3303 | 3302 | Good. Shut up then.
1271 | 3305 | 3304 | Go on then. Let's get it over with.
1272 | 1401 | 1400 | You mean that bright shiny blue thing?
1273 | 1403 | 1402 | That's Titania's Vision Center.
1274 | 1405 | 1404 | It's the Vision Center.
1275 | 2909 | 2908 | Nothing.
1276 | 2927 | 2926 | Last time I looked - the bar.
1277 | 3271 | 3270 | It's a giant fractal image of my ass. What do you think it is?
1278 | 3339 | 3338 | It controls my moods. So you just stay away from it - all right?
1279 | 2869 | 2868 | Are you blind as well as stupid? I'm the BarBot. Is there a role low enough in life for you?
1280 | 2989 | 2988 | What are you going to do now then?
1281 | 2819 | 2818 | That's what I say when I look at you.
1282 | 3363 | 3362 | Time you did something useful.
1283 | 3381 | 3380 | Whenever you like - no one else cares.
1284 | 3383 | 3382 | Have you ever heard the word 'bar'?
1285 | 3385 | 3384 | Never wondered what the word restaurant meant?
1286 | 2919 | 2918 | DeskBot's in the Embarkation Lobby.
1287 | 3241 | 3240 | I don't know. In the fuse box?
1288 | 3245 | 3244 | How should I know? Somebody must have taken the fuses.
1289 | 3247 | 3246 | Bots aren't allowed in Titania's Room.
1290 | 3249 | 3248 | Leovinus, Brobostigon and Scraliontis.
1291 | 3243 | 3242 | Do I have to tell you everything? Look in Titania's Room.
1292 | 2917 | 2916 | LiftBot's in the elevators - of course I wouldn't expect you to work that out.
1293 | 2915 | 2914 | First engage your brain. Then use your PET.
1294 | 2911 | 2910 | Always complaining aren't you?
1295 | 2921 | 2920 | RowBots normally stick around the canal. Funny that.
1296 | 2885 | 2884 | Blerontin.
1297 | 2899 | 2898 | There aren't any. Cross your legs can't you?
1298 | 2901 | 2900 | Look, nobody's perfect. They got forgotten. You'll just have to cope.
1299 | 2903 | 2902 | We were going to Vastan. Now we're just drifting out of control.
1300 | 2905 | 2904 | Mislaid is a more polite way of putting it.

1318 | 3433 | 3432 | The Parrot.
1319 | 3443 | 3442 | The RowBot.

1322 | 3437 | 3436 | The Succ-U-Bus.
1323 | 3409 | 3408 | Titania.
1324 | 3421 | 3420 | You.
1325 | 2699 | 2698 | What do I care?
1326 | 1421 | 1420 | The bar's empty because - there's nobody in it.
1327 | 1423 | 1422 | There's nobody in it - because there are no passengers.
1328 | 2755 | 2754 | You're an easy target that's why.
1329 | 3395 | 3394 | Nothing. You wouldn't find it funny.
1330 | 3397 | 3396 | Really. You wouldn't understand.
1331 | 3399 | 3398 | You wouldn't get it. OK? Just leave it. Forget it.
1332 | 3401 | 3400 | FORGET IT! ALL RIGHT?! IT NEVER HAPPENED!
1333 | 2691 | 2690 | Because my Cellpoint is set at unpleasant.
1334 | 2757 | 2756 | Just the way I'm programmed I guess. I kinda like it.
1335 | 3275 | 3274 | Wrong.
1336 | 2701 | 2700 | Funny, that's just what I think of you.
1337 | 2639 | 2638 | That's my business - all right?
1338 | 2651 | 2650 | I'll tell you what I like. Any Bar without you in it.
1339 | 3309 | 3308 | It's my sandwiches.
1340 | 3307 | 3306 | It's a transparent parrot-sized battle-helmet.
1341 | 3321 | 3320 | It's a plinth used for displaying the internal organs of customers who displease me.
1342 | 3313 | 3312 | It's an instrument for hooking peanuts out of Bot's ears.
1343 | 3315 | 3314 | It's a tiny angel.
1344 | 3317 | 3316 | It's a piece of leather, vital for the popular game of pouch thronging.
1345 | 3319 | 3318 | It's a device for removing brains from the skulls of unwanted guests.
1346 | 3311 | 3310 | It's a finger protector.
1347 | 3297 | 3296 | It's a bar.
1348 | 3279 | 3278 | It's a bell.
1349 | 3287 | 3286 | It's the way out.
1350 | 3277 | 3276 | It's a glass.
1351 | 3293 | 3292 | It's the list of ingredients for the Titanic Titillator.
1352 | 3291 | 3290 | It's the cocktail monitor.
1353 | 3299 | 3298 | It's that damn parrot again.
1354 | 3289 | 3288 | It's the Pellerator.
1355 | 3283 | 3282 | It's a picture.
1356 | 3295 | 3294 | It's a Succ-U-Bus.
1357 | 3281 | 3280 | It's a Vision Center.
1358 | 3285 | 3284 | It's somebody's idea of tasteful wallpaper.
1359 | 3859 | 3858 | Mmm. Deeply uninteresting.
1360 | 1803 | 1802 | No time - it's work, work work for me.
1361 | 2095 | 2094 | We're already there.
1362 | 1865 | 1864 | Interested in weather are you?
1363 | 1867 | 1866 | You'd like the Arboretum.
1364 | 1869 | 1868 | Ah well, I wouldn't like to spoil the surprise.
1365 | 1871 | 1870 | You ought to take a gander at the Arboretum - that might change your mind.
1366 | 2571 | 2570 | Nasty weather. Nasty mess I'm in too.
1367 | 2569 | 2568 | Nice weather - but nasty mess I'm in all right.
1368 | 1853 | 1852 | Fortillian Bantoburn O'Perfluous at your service. Welcome to the Starship Titanic, Bar of Bars. And what can I get you?
1369 | 3639 | 3638 | That's the cocktail menu server monitor.
1370 | 3641 | 3640 | It serves the cocktail menus to me. I serve the cocktails to you. The wonders of modern cyberscience, eh? Except it's serving up some right nonsense at the moment.
1371 | 3643 | 3642 | It's all got a bit garbled. But a BarBot's got to mix what a BarBot's got to mix.
1372 | 1935 | 1934 | Last time I looked - an extensive array of exotic beverages.
1373 | 2327 | 2326 | The usual - shelves, bottles, amphorae, Vision Center, glasses.
1374 | 1883 | 1882 | I'm the BarBot. What line are you in?
1375 | 1849 | 1848 | Are you crazy? There is no point.
1376 | 3765 | 3764 | Ninety smorbits.
1377 | 3767 | 3766 | A ninetieth of a bibbit.
1378 | 1927 | 1926 | DeskBot's in the Embarkation Lobby.
1379 | 2289 | 2288 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1380 | 2293 | 2292 | Perhaps somebody took them for safe keeping?
1381 | 2295 | 2294 | Bots aren't allowed into Titania's room. They fall off the ceiling.
1382 | 2297 | 2296 | Leovinus, Scraliontis, Brobostigon for example.
1383 | 2291 | 2290 | The ship is controlled from Titania's room. I expect the fuse box is around there somewhere.
1384 | 1925 | 1924 | LiftBot's in the lifts - like me, he doesn't get around much.
1385 | 1931 | 1930 | Maitre D'Bot doesn't move from the 1st Class Restaurant.
1386 | 1923 | 1922 | All you have to do is call him. Use your PET.
1387 | 1919 | 1918 | Well, we were on our way to Vastan to pick up our first passengers, but we got slightly lost.
1388 | 1929 | 1928 | RowBots normally stick around the canal.
1389 | 1907 | 1906 | Don't ask me why, but there isn't one here.
1390 | 1909 | 1908 | I can only assume they forgot about them when they built the ship. Still that's what maiden voyages are for - finding all those little mistakes.
1391 | 3525 | 3524 | I've got a bottle of finest Signurian Vodka right here. I'll whip up a shot for you as soon as I finish this Titanic Titillator.
1392 | 3527 | 3526 | I've got a bottle of finest Signurian Vodka right here. Obviously, being Signurian, it has to go into the cocktail last.
1393 | 1911 | 1910 | We were headed for Vastan, but now I think we're a wee bit lost.
1394 | 1913 | 1912 | Nothing serious. Just drifting, out of control through the dark void of space.
1395 | 1903 | 1902 | Blerontin.

1419 | 2577 | 2576 | Titania.
1420 | 2589 | 2588 | You.
1421 | 1737 | 1736 | Why?
1422 | 1733 | 1732 | Why not?
1423 | 3697 | 3696 | Yes.
1424 | 3699 | 3698 | Yes.
1425 | 3701 | 3700 | Yes.
1426 | 3703 | 3702 | Yes.
1427 | 3705 | 3704 | Oh, yes.
1428 | 3731 | 3730 | Yeah.
1429 | 3739 | 3738 | Yeah.
1430 | 3741 | 3740 | Yes.
1431 | 3637 | 3636 | You would think so, wouldn't you?
1432 | 1679 | 1678 | Oh, you get no time to fancy in this business.
1433 | 3579 | 3578 | I don't lie. I always tell the truth.
1434 | 3581 | 3580 | I don't tell lies. The BellBot tells lies.
1435 | 3583 | 3582 | I don't lie. The DoorBot is a liar. Not me.
1436 | 1691 | 1690 | I like anything that doesn't involve mopping up afterwards.
1437 | 947 | 946 | Do you think a flying fish display would go down well with the guests? Trouble is when they power down they can make quite a mess. A bit of music would help but I don't know how we get them fellas down from the music room. Perhaps a few games: I could set up a Gargle-Blatting alley but we'd need to provide a sweatbox; there's Flingy of course but there's not much room for a run-up and tempers can get raised; there's Pouch-Thronging but that can get out of hand and the last thing we need is a visit from the Belt Morality Testers. Ah well, maybe it's not to be... Now what was that you were saying? Ah yes.
1438 | 609 | 608 | No I've not but I think they keep one in the First Class Restaurant.
1439 | 431 | 430 | If my responses have been in any way unsatisfactory, I shall have them rectified immediately.
1440 | 7 | 6 | Well if I were you I'd drop it in the Canal.
1441 | 27 | 26 | Very decent of you I'm sure. I prefer my starling puree as a body rub.
1442 | 535 | 534 | I'm mixing this cocktail for the very eminent and distinguished Mister Leovinus. Not merely the most charming of gentlemen - but also as it happens, a veritable prince among tippers.
1443 | 573 | 572 | Aaah. I'm afraid I wouldn't have anything of that nature here.
1444 | 555 | 554 | Ah for sure you just missed him. He walked out of that door not five nanoseconds before you came in. I'm sure it was nothing personal.
1445 | 51 | 50 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I was telling the truth.
1446 | 53 | 52 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I wasn't telling you the truth.
1447 | 55 | 54 | I have to be honest with ya: I'd be lying if I told ya I was telling you the truth.
1448 | 73 | 72 | Thank you for your comment which I shall pass on to the management: I can assure you I'm as fit as a futtle.
1449 | 89 | 88 | Well I'm pleased to hear that: you'll find money's very useful on this ship.
1450 | 501 | 500 | I'll be finished in just one second.
1451 | 465 | 464 | It would be my absolute pleasure.
1452 | 109 | 108 | Well it couldn't be easier: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Grand Canal.
1453 | 337 | 336 | Take the glass and go to the Arboretum.
1454 | 339 | 338 | Take the glass and go to the Art Gallery.
1455 | 341 | 340 | Take the glass and go to the Music Room.
1456 | 513 | 512 | A truly excellent suggestion. To be perfectly honest, I doubt the riffraff element could tell the difference between a cocktail and a cockatiel anyway.
1457 | 343 | 342 | Take the glass and go to the Parrot Lobby.
1458 | 333 | 332 | Well that couldn't be easier.
1459 | 335 | 334 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant.
1460 | 589 | 588 | Oh, my sainted krypto-Aunt - how remiss of me. You don't need to puree them at all! Jars of Arcturan Sun-Dried Starling Puree are readily available from the First Class Restaurant.
1461 | 317 | 316 | Very interesting. I do find you so full of wonderful ideas.
1462 | 711 | 710 | Well yes, I think you're right. You'd better get along there straight away.
1463 | 133 | 132 | Fret not my friend. The starling puree can now be found in the Arboretum.
1464 | 155 | 154 | My but I do admire your endeavor. Soon we can have a Titanic Titillator. It's my favorite.
1465 | 157 | 156 | My but I do admire your endeavor. Soon we can have a Titanic Titillator. Ah. Hmm! A Titanic Titillator. It's my favorite.
1466 | 183 | 182 | You're a caring decent fellow but I wouldn't worry: the starlings positively enjoy it.
1467 | 411 | 410 | Oh yes tea you'll find we've got plenty of tea. I'll make you a little pot right away.
1468 | 205 | 204 | You just say what you feel and don't worry about me: my shrinkware tells me that the problem here is not my bar but your opinion of it.
1469 | 395 | 394 | How could any fellow POSSIBLY refuse such a charmingly phrased offer?
1470 | 225 | 224 | To be honest, it wouldn't hurt me - I always wear a throat guard on duty.
1471 | 481 | 480 | You'll not find a TV on this ship oh no.
1472 | 447 | 446 | Ah well now that's an easy one. Pop down to Marsinta at check-in and ask her if she could have one delivered to your room.
1473 | 727 | 726 | On the contrary it's rather a surprising little fellow - muted color, deep mango hints and a kick like a Barrolingian fighting dog.
1474 | 373 | 372 | Certainly, coming right up.
1475 | 257 | 256 | I'm glad you're interested: I am mixing equal quantities of heavy water and light ale in the hope of creating a medium dry white.
1476 | 777 | 776 | I'd get back to your room and wait there - I've a funny feeling luck's going to come knocking at your door...
1477 | 827 | 826 | Well now if I were you I'd check out the restaurants.
1478 | 811 | 810 | The thing with starlings is they migrate South this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them in the Bilge Room.
1479 | 279 | 278 | I wouldn't worry about that; you'll find one in your bedroom.
1480 | 299 | 298 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying: the great Scraliontis ordered it last night when he came in.
1481 | 605 | 604 | Sadly I've nothing in the bar which might meet your requirements.
1482 | 429 | 428 | Look buddy, this is my bar and I'll do what I like in it Capisce?
1483 | 1 | 0 | Well if I were you I'd drop it in the Well.
1484 | 23 | 22 | You're a decent fella you are but I have to decline; I never touch the stuff.
1485 | 531 | 530 | I'm mixing this cocktail for the very eminent and distinguished Mister Brobostigon. Not merely the most charming of gentlemen - but also as it happens, a veritable prince among tippers.
1486 | 787 | 786 | You're a genius so you are. Well now, hang onto your hat and let's mix cocktails!
1487 | 569 | 568 | One glass. At your service.
1488 | 551 | 550 | Leovinus? I've not seen him for weeks.
1489 | 47 | 46 | I've got to be honest: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1490 | 69 | 68 | Thank you for your comment which I shall pass on to the management: I must admit, I am feeling a wee bit unnecessary today.
1491 | 83 | 82 | Well I'm pleased to hear that but money's not important on this ship.
1492 | 497 | 496 | Ah well I'd love be going quicker me self but I seem to be stuck making this little cocktail.
1493 | 461 | 460 | I'm afraid that won't be possible. Might I tempt you instead to my specialty, the Titanic Titillator? It won't take long to rustle up.
1494 | 103 | 102 | Well it couldn't be easier: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator.
1495 | 329 | 328 | Well that couldn't be easier. Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1496 | 509 | 508 | I'm afraid this recipe is VERY clear about the starling element. Pureed parrot, you see, is only ever used in the mixing of RUM-based beverages. Stands to reason when you think about it.
1497 | 585 | 584 | Well now that's a tricky one. You'd need a big blender for a job like that.
1498 | 313 | 312 | Very interesting. I must admit I have not heard of the individual in question.
1499 | 707 | 706 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist. But if it's starling puree you're after I suspect you'll be wanting a room with some kind of a tap.
1500 | 709 | 708 | Well now from memory I suspect the SGT Restaurant could be a good place to start.
1501 | 129 | 128 | Fret not, my friend. The starling puree can now be found in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1502 | 149 | 148 | Oh yes? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before.
1503 | 179 | 178 | Yes it's a nasty job but someone's got to do it.
1504 | 407 | 406 | I'm so sorry the answer's no I'm afraid.
1505 | 199 | 198 | Well I'm sorry you feel like that, I'm proud of this bar.
1506 | 391 | 390 | Now, now, if I weren't to know better I might go taking that as some sort of veiled threat.
1507 | 219 | 218 | To be honest, it would hurt.
1508 | 477 | 476 | You'll find TV sets throughout the ship - a whole galaxy of entertainment at your fingertips.
1509 | 443 | 442 | A minor task. You simply get some TV sets and then you crush them.
1510 | 725 | 724 | I couldn't agree with you more. The starlings don't like it much either.
1511 | 237 | 236 | Certainly just as soon as I've finished mixing this cocktail.
1512 | 369 | 368 | I'm all a-jangle with the anticipation of serving you -but I'm afraid you'll have to wait till I've finished this.
1513 | 253 | 252 | I'm glad you're interested: I am mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1514 | 743 | 742 | A slug of Signurian Vodka, a slice of lemon, a crushed TV set and a pureed flock of starlings.
1515 | 771 | 770 | Enjoy the ship - that's what it's here for.
1516 | 823 | 822 | Well now I'd suggest looking for a lemon tree.
1517 | 807 | 806 | The thing with starlings is they migrate South this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them on the Promenade Deck.
1518 | 273 | 272 | Sorry to disappoint you but the only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck.
1519 | 283 | 282 | You see the only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck and they're purely ornamental.
1520 | 291 | 290 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying: the mighty Brobostigon ordered it last night when he came in.
1521 | 759 | 758 | Sorry about that. I was lying through what remains of my teeth. Damn this metal corrosion.
1522 | 691 | 690 | State of the art - that's what they say about Titania. Most sophisticated cyberintelligence ever created - runs the whole ship.
1523 | 937 | 936 | I had a body once you know - Very messy it was, needed lots of maintenance, everything you did involved wiping, always wiping. Very unreliable. Since I got scanned though and worked my way up to the Halycon Multimix Ironymaster that you see in front of you I've been a very happy bot. No smells, no embarrassments, no sudden urges that have to be contained. Occasionally I get a little whiff of pleasure if I go too near a power unit, but I can handle it. Anyway I mustn't bore you... You were just now asking me something... Ay yes.
1524 | 611 | 610 | We don't have one here but I know they have one in the First Class Restaurant. Not that you'll have the intelligence to get there.
1525 | 433 | 432 | There's nothing wrong with the way I talk my friend and if you really have problems with it, I suggest you get off at the next stop.
1526 | 5 | 4 | Can you work out nothing for yourself weasel brain? Drop it in the Canal.
1527 | 29 | 28 | Very kind of you but I must decline: I never accept offers from customers I despise.
1528 | 537 | 536 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for a Mister Scraliontis.
1529 | 575 | 574 | What do you think this is - a bar or something? We haven't got any.
1530 | 557 | 556 | Ah for sure you just missed him. He walked out of that door not five nanoseconds before you came in. Not that he would have stopped to talk to you.
1531 | 57 | 56 | You insult me but I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I was telling you the truth.
1532 | 59 | 58 | You insult me but I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1533 | 75 | 74 | When I want your opinion I'll ask for it duck-face. The only thing wrong with me is the headache I've got listening to you.
1534 | 87 | 86 | Reduced to bragging now are we? You'll find money's very useful on this ship.
1535 | 499 | 498 | I find it astonishing that you want me to go quicker when your own evolution has so clearly gone at a snail's pace.
1536 | 467 | 466 | If it'll stop your incessant drivel for even half a picosecond, I'd be delighted to.
1537 | 107 | 106 | You get to the Promenade Deck via the Grand Canal, and the sooner you're out of my sight the better.
1538 | 349 | 348 | Take the glass and go to the Arboretum.
1539 | 351 | 350 | Take the glass and go to the Art Gallery.
1540 | 353 | 352 | Take the glass and go to the Music Room.
1541 | 515 | 514 | That flea bitten feather bag must surely rank as the only creature on this entire ship whose conversation I find even more boring and repetitive than your own. Go ahead, puree it.
1542 | 355 | 354 | Take the glass and go to the Parrot Lobby.
1543 | 345 | 344 | Well that couldn't be easier. Even for a pultronic idiot such as yourself.
1544 | 347 | 346 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant.
1545 | 591 | 590 | Frankly I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you. Although I suspect you might find the phrase "Giant Fan" to be somewhat pertinent.
1546 | 319 | 318 | Bit of a name-dropper aren't we?
1547 | 715 | 714 | Well for once mutton-head you seem to have got the right answer. You'd better get down there straight away before your luck changes.
1548 | 723 | 722 | If you're not using the cerebrum for intelligent thought, I wonder if I could borrow it later to swab down the bar? There's only one place on this ship where I've seen anything remotely capable of delivering pureed starlings and that's exactly the room you've just mentioned. Sorry about that, I just so enjoy insulting you it's impossible to give you good news straight.
1549 | 135 | 134 | You are useless at this. Look, if it's starling puree you're after, I'd try the Arboretum.
1550 | 159 | 158 | You're pushing your luck sunshine. This isn't pureed starling. It's pureed hamster you evil rodent reducer.
1551 | 161 | 160 | Alright, I'll let you off. But only if you say I'm the nicest BarBot you've ever met.
1552 | 165 | 164 | I suppose you think I'll suddenly be nice to you if you come on all tough. Well think again worm.
1553 | 163 | 162 | You really are a fawning little toad aren't you. Of all the creeps on all the planets you're right up there with the real squirmers.
1554 | 185 | 184 | Shows how little you know: the starlings positively enjoy it.
1555 | 413 | 412 | This is a BAR d'ya understand? We serve DRINKS FOR ADULTS! DRINKS FOR REAL MEN! DRINKS FOR REAL WOMEN! And you ask me for tea. Is there no end to this indignity? All right, I'll make your tea you little wuss!
1556 | 203 | 202 | Your mindless vitriol affects me not one jot: your opinions are about as useful as hemorrhoids on a jockey.
1557 | 397 | 396 | Since you put it like that potato face, nothing would fill me with greater pleasure than to comply.
1558 | 223 | 222 | What could you possibly do to me mutton brain: it wouldn't hurt me.
1559 | 483 | 482 | You're a sloth what are you? Five minutes you've been on this ship and you want to slink off to watch TV. Well tough cos. there aren't any on the ship.
1560 | 449 | 448 | Just this once you bag of bones and water I'll tell you: go down to the DeskBot and ask her very very nicely to send one to your room.
1561 | 731 | 730 | How little you know about the mysterious art of the cocktail BarBot. This drink is a delight, a wonder, a creation and you are not worthy to speak its name.
1562 | 241 | 240 | Welcome to Eejit Happy Hour, I think you'll feel quite at home. If you're after the vision center I think you'll find it in the Arboretum. It's not a trinket kept in a bar.
1563 | 375 | 374 | Anything to distract that busy little thorax of yours - I'll pour you one straight away.
1564 | 259 | 258 | It's got bugger all to do with you but: I am mixing equal quantities of heavy water and light ale in the hope of creating a medium dry white.
1565 | 775 | 774 | If I were you I'd head back to your room and wait for something to happen because the chances of you getting anything right on your own are zilch.
1566 | 829 | 828 | You really are quite dim aren't you. Try the restaurants, that's the obvious place.
1567 | 813 | 812 | Do I LOOK like the sort of fella with time to waste on idle ornithological observations? They could be taking a bracing mid-morning stroll along the Grand Axial Canal for all I know.
1568 | 277 | 276 | It grieves me to have to help you: you'll find one in your bedroom.
1569 | 303 | 302 | Me, potato face.
1570 | 301 | 300 | Try engaging a few neurons in that bread basket you call a head: I'm making it for someone to drink.
1571 | 607 | 606 | It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I have none.
1572 | 427 | 426 | I apologize profusely for any confusion caused, which I am sure, is entirely my fault.
1573 | 3 | 2 | Can you work out nothing for yourself you brainless divot? Drop it in the Well.
1574 | 25 | 24 | I suppose you think you're being funny; I can't imagine a more foul brew than starling puree.
1575 | 533 | 532 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for a Mister Brobostigon.
1576 | 789 | 788 | Well about time too. Now, step back. I've got a job to do.
1577 | 571 | 570 | One glass. No ice, no slice. If it's got slime on it you'll just have to lick it off.
1578 | 553 | 552 | The answer to that is quite patently none of your frog-frotting business. How should I know where he is - he's not been in the bar for weeks.
1579 | 49 | 48 | You nasty little worm, coming into my bar and calling me a liar. Well, I shall not be provoked: I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you the truth.
1580 | 71 | 70 | You just can't keep your insidious opinions to yourself can you? If I'm not feeling well it's no business yours.
1581 | 85 | 84 | Reduced to bragging now are we? You really are a tasteless toad.
1582 | 495 | 494 | Why not pop back to your room and watch it there.
1583 | 463 | 462 | In a word sponge brain - no.
1584 | 105 | 104 | You get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator, and the sooner you're out of my sight the better.
1585 | 331 | 330 | You pathetic sniveling pseudo-replicant of intelligent life: take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1586 | 511 | 510 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view.
1587 | 587 | 586 | Frankly I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you. Although I suspect you might find the phrase "fan-assisted" to be somewhat pertinent.
1588 | 315 | 314 | Bit of a name-dropper aren't we? As it happens I've never heard of them.
1589 | 713 | 712 | How should I know? I suggest you dose yourself up with a few brain cells and try and work it out for yourself.
1590 | 131 | 130 | My heart bleeds for you. Have you tried the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant?
1591 | 151 | 150 | You're pushing your luck sunshine. For all I know this is pureed snipe.
1592 | 153 | 152 | Oh yes and I'm a monkey's coder. All right I believe you, but only because you're too pathetic to cheat me.
1593 | 181 | 180 | To be honest I'd much rather be pureeing you but sadly I'm programmed to resist that urge.
1594 | 409 | 408 | Tea? TEA? This is a BAR d'ya understand? We serve DRINKS FOR ADULTS! DRINKS FOR REAL MEN! DRINKS FOR REAL WOMEN! There'll be no tea served in this bar.
1595 | 201 | 200 | I don't give a rancid fig for your opinions: I'm proud of this bar.
1596 | 393 | 392 | Care to step outside? Because if you would, then as soon as I've finished mixing this, I'll personally assist your speedy exit through the nearest airlock with the help of a large plutonium crowbar.
1597 | 221 | 220 | What do you think would happen you dorf - it would hurt.
1598 | 479 | 478 | You're a sloth what are you? Five minutes you've been on this ship and you want to slink off to watch TV. Huh.
1599 | 445 | 444 | You may find this difficult to understand being of micro-brain: first you get yourself a TV set and then you crush it.
1600 | 729 | 728 | You're not qualified to pass judgement upon my little cocktail, but as it happens you're right.
1601 | 239 | 238 | Welcome to Eejit Happy Hour, I think you'll feel quite at home. The vision center is a highly sophisticated piece of equipment. I'll give it to you when I've finished making this cocktail but you'd better be careful with it.
1602 | 371 | 370 | Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your insectoid attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1603 | 255 | 254 | It's got bogger all to do with you but as it happens I'm mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1604 | 745 | 744 | You nosey beggar. If you must know: A slug of Signurian Vodka, a slice of lemon, a crushed TV set and a pureed flock of starlings.
1605 | 773 | 772 | If I were you I'd look around the ship and while you do so think on how you might improve yourself.
1606 | 825 | 824 | You really are quite dim aren't you. Try looking for a lemon tree.
1607 | 809 | 808 | Do I LOOK like the sort of fella with time to waste on idle ornithological observations? They could be taking a mid-morning stroll round the Promenade Deck for all I know.
1608 | 275 | 274 | I so enjoy giving you bad news: there's a few starlings knocking about the Promenade Deck but that's all I know.
1609 | 297 | 296 | Mr. Brobostigon to you. He was the Project Manager for the ship.
1610 | 295 | 294 | My but you're a nosy pittock - Brobostigon asked me to.
1611 | 293 | 292 | Why not engage a few neurons in that bread basket you call a head - somebody asked me to.
1612 | 761 | 760 | I enjoyed that. I do hope you wasted some time. I was spitefully and maliciously lying at the time - it's an occasional condition which I'm beginning to enjoy.
1613 | 693 | 692 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl - completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin.
1614 | 961 | 960 | My but you've some strong language on you.
1615 | 963 | 962 | I'm terribly grateful for that comment sir but I would advise a little caution in the profanity department.
1616 | 965 | 964 | Please do not swear at the BarBots it may embarrass them.
1617 | 967 | 966 | BarBots may be prone to shut-down at certain sustained obscenity levels.
1618 | 985 | 984 | Well now you won't hear me using language like that.
1619 | 987 | 986 | My you're a one for the strong language aren't you?
1620 | 989 | 988 | Oh now you're making me blush.
1621 | 991 | 990 | You'll be showing me your tattoos next won't you.
1622 | 993 | 992 | You're a proper devil with those naughty words now aren't you.
1623 | 943 | 942 | You know you'd never believe it to look at me but I was once quite a big thing in TV - I was a pixel inspector on a DIY movie chat line. Well I can tell you, if I'd had stalks my eyes would have popped out on them. I only lasted a few days - total burn out. Since then I've been re-foliated and I've lost all interest in hot metal. I've no regrets though... Now what were you saying before I so rudely interrupted. Oh yes.
1624 | 959 | 958 | I wonder now have you been down to that dismal establishment they call the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant? I expect you're familiar with the place, they DO tend to cater for the more riff-raffish end of the social spectrum. No culture at all in that godforsaken place... unless you count what's growing on the food. I mean call me picky, call me faddy but unless they've employed the services of the galaxy's foremost genetic engineers, I don't expect to find fur on a chicken. Just take my advice and avoid the deep fried nuggets, that's all I can say. Anyway you were asking me something. Ah yes now...
1625 | 921 | 920 | Don't you just love chickens? To think that for thousands of years we all thought they were just plain dumb! Well that was some surprise, the day that giant roasting tin popped through the atmosphere and the GrandMaster Chicken hopped out. Wanted to know how the chickens had been treated while he was away. I was working at the time as a guidance system on a Chicken Surprise Farm. I thought we were in for trouble that night. But you were asking after something...
1626 | 923 | 922 | SO where was I? Oh yes the chicken farm. Anyway, I hung around with the StuffBots and we all watched as the chickens trooped off to the canteen to vote. "This house holds that it's better to be roasted nicely with a few spuds than it is to worry about evolving and setting up a civilization". There was only one vote against (a radical turkey had sneaked in at the back). Five minutes later they were back in the queue grinning ear to ear demanding to be wrung and stuffed. What a day. Ah well.
1627 | 917 | 916 | Did I ever tell you I was there with the great Babalanians when they won The Blood-Filled Gourd? I was a lowly auto hatchet at first - but as the day wore on I got meself belt-clipped to the great Clem Grunt. I was in awe. Clem had just broken all transfer records. Patrick had not only put three lunar funworlds on the table, they'd also agreed to the ritual sacrifice of five thousand supporters. And this was his first game. But I digress. What was that you were saying?
1628 | 945 | 944 | Do you know what I'm doing now? I'm exercising my suave upper torso in preparation for my starring role in the Grand Crossing The Line Ceremony. During the festivities we Bots are given full license to hunt down the most annoying passengers. After capturing the little beggars the crew are provided with giant slings with which to fire them from the aft deck towards the nearest star. Now that's what I call entertainment. But how rude of me. You had a question. Ah yes.
1629 | 791 | 790 | That's perfect. All I need now is a chicken garnish.
1630 | 793 | 792 | Well thanks, I didn't need it actually. I was lying. And as it happens, I'm not going to make the cocktail now. It's too late.
1631 | 747 | 746 | Ah well now that's a secret, sorry.
1632 | 695 | 694 | Titania? She's just the statue at the top of the Grand Central well.
1633 | 795 | 794 | Aren't you the clever one. Shame you forgot the chicken garnish. You'd better go and get it dumb-butt.
1634 | 797 | 796 | Fell for that one didn't you. I didn't need it actually. I was lying. I'm not going to make the cocktail now. It's too late.
1635 | 749 | 748 | Why should I tell you, you nosey beggar. Anyway it's a secret.
1636 | 769 | 768 | Not impressed with my travel recommendations, eh? Might I offer this one instead then? Frog off. If you really want to know why I suggested you visit that room, it's very simple. I was evidently suffering a temporary memory lapse. It happens to most mechanoids of my age: decelerating metal decline.
1637 | 697 | 696 | You are beneath contempt. Been in the bar five minutes and you're after picking up women. Well Titania doesn't exist. She's a statue. Capisce?
1638 | 899 | 898 | What's your view of facial hair I wonder - on a woman? My mother now had a full beard and a very fine accessory it was. Tailor-made mind you, not off the peg. We sent off for it after seeing some write-ups in Tache Galactica. You know, she never looked back once it was fitted. Didn't look forward much either come to think of it. Of course it's not so fashionable now, most youngsters draw the line at a fine display of ear hair, or maybe a few nose curls but I do miss the drama of those days. But I digress...
1639 | 925 | 924 | Ever been fishing? The peace, the quiet. The scent of new-mown hay, the sound of little birds nesting. The warm, gentle sun of a summer afternoon, tiny insects hovering, dipping, skating on the surface of the water. I hate all that. No, fishing to me means combat, life or death struggles, heart-pounding, axe-wielding bloody battles, up to your neck in icy water with a giant Wetback throwing punches, desperate moments when a knee-spike threatens your throat, those big furry claws tearing at your limbs, that glorious sensation when you roll back onto dry land and the lob-bomb go off. That's a sport to make you feel alive eh? But I'm getting off the point here. What was it you asked me? Oh yes now.
1640 | 841 | 840 | Can you not see there's a bot in trouble here? Give us a hand with this cocktail will you.
1641 | 859 | 858 | Good. Have a good butchers at that cocktail list and see what you can do.
1642 | 861 | 860 | Fair enough. If you've no sense of decency then I've no wish to talk to you anyway.
1643 | 863 | 862 | I've got starling puree, now get me lemons and crushed TV's.
1644 | 865 | 864 | I've got starling puree and lemons. Now get me crushed TV's.
1645 | 867 | 866 | I've got starling puree and TV's. Now get me lemons.
1646 | 869 | 868 | I've got crushed TV's. Now get me starling puree and lemons.
1647 | 871 | 870 | I've got crushed TV's and lemons. Now get me starling puree.
1648 | 873 | 872 | I've got lemons. Now get me crushed TV's and starling puree.
1649 | 875 | 874 | Where's the ingredients for this cocktail - that's more important.
1650 | 877 | 876 | Where's Leovinus? He'd fix this little mess, no problem.
1651 | 843 | 842 | Until I have completed this cocktailian task I have no time for idle chatter.
1652 | 879 | 878 | When are you going to get off your backside and give us a bit of help?
1653 | 881 | 880 | When am I going to get someone who knows what they're doing in here?
1654 | 883 | 882 | Don't ask me. If I knew that I wouldn't be stuck here like this. Give us a hand can't you?
1655 | 885 | 884 | Why did it have to be me?
1656 | 887 | 886 | Who's going to sort out Brobostigon and Scraliontis - that's what I want to know. They seem to be responsible for most of what's gone wrong round here.
1657 | 889 | 888 | To be honest I don't really care. All I care about is what help you're going to give me.
1658 | 891 | 890 | Who knows: There's more important things to worry about. Such as me.
1659 | 893 | 892 | How should I know? I'm just a lovely BarBot trapped in a fiendish cocktail predicament.
1660 | 845 | 844 | Help us out with this cocktail will you, then we'll have time for a chat.
1661 | 847 | 846 | This is no time for discourse - this is a time for action: get me starling puree, get me TV's, get me lemons. Get me out of this mess.
1662 | 849 | 848 | Look - I've no time for idle chatter. I've a cocktail to make here.
1663 | 851 | 850 | Never mind that. Have you no sense of charity - I'm in great need of a helping hand here.
1664 | 853 | 852 | Holy Kaboli. Are you just going to gawk and make inane comments? Look at the cocktail menu and get to work why don't you?
1665 | 855 | 854 | It's a fiendish look I'm in here - and you're my only hope of getting out of it. Is there nothing you can do?
1666 | 857 | 856 | You help me - then I'll talk to you. Is that a deal?
1667 | 929 | 928 | Gravity's a bit light today don't you think? If it carries on like this we could be in for quite a weekend. Nowhere worse than a bar in a gravity storm as I'm sure you know, clears the place faster than a Racatan in a Glabian Leisure Pool. Ah well back to work. You were asking me something. Ah yes.
1668 | 933 | 932 | To be honest I've not been feeling myself recently. You know what I need? A holiday. There's a little health farm on the outer rim of Skopolopoloi that's the nearest thing I know to virtual heaven. A couple of weeks there and I'd come home a new bot, sleek, shiny, top of the range neutral upgrade, the old bonhomie reservoir cleaned and re-filled. But there I go again dreaming. Where were we? You had a question for me. Oh yes.
1669 | 81 | 80 | Well isn't this just a case of the pot calling the kettle black. You're an embarrassment to your species: if I were you I would disembark at the next port, find the local Customs House, ask them to extract your genetic coding, and insist they destroy it in the name of all intelligent life. We must not risk your accidental replication whilst while you are absent from your home planet. You are the most abnormal creature I ever scanned. It is absurd that you should question my state. Only I can do that. And I'm going to. There. I just did. And on reflection: yes, I appear to be going mad. Let's change the subject.
1670 | 321 | 320 | Well isn't it a funny thing the number of people I meet who think that just because I work in a bar I must have met everyone in the galaxy who's plied the same trade. If only it were true. Now just give me a minute while I do a wee spot of brain racking.
1671 | 617 | 616 | I know where you'll find one - in the first class restaurant.
1672 | 437 | 436 | I apologize profusely for any confusion but I'm answering as best as is humanly possible. Which considering that I'm not, in fact, human - represents a significant personal achievement. Far be it from me to consider - to even consider CONSIDERING - the upsetting of one of my valued clientele with a dishonest or unnecessarily long-winded, verbose, tautological or otherwise-less-than-satisfactory reply. Starting immediately I'll cut my replies back ruthlessly. With immediate effect. From right now. This minute. This very second.
1673 | 13 | 12 | Well, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun, then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury. Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV would be to drop it down the well.
1674 | 15 | 14 | Still, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury? Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV set would be to get the parrot to squash it in his beak.
1675 | 35 | 34 | Thanks for the offer but I only drink pureed starling with a cherry on the top.
1676 | 37 | 36 | The best place to find cherries is by the DeskBot. Marsinta has a secret stash.
1677 | 541 | 540 | OR in fact the fellow I was talking about - Mr. Leovinus.
1678 | 579 | 578 | Now, where did I put them don't tell me. don't tell me. next to the pickled walnuts, wasn't it ? No? Did I put them next to the swizzle sticks with the novelty figure of Titania on the end? Or did I put it with that framed photograph of Jargranthur Pynjj - legendary inventor of the fully-automatic, reflex-action, pushbutton-operated cocktail umbrella. Ah no, I remember now. We don't have any. Sorry.
1679 | 561 | 560 | Of course, I know where he'll be - picking lemons in the Arboretum.
1680 | 79 | 78 | Certainly not.
1681 | 95 | 94 | So you can see: your money's going to be very useful on this ship.
1682 | 471 | 470 | Would you like to try my specialty - the Titanic Titillator? Well. I say specialty, I haven't actually succeeded in making one yet, but had I succeeded, I can assure you this drink would be renowned throughout the universe as one of the most exquisite concoctions ever to have, hypothetically as it were enchanted the gullet, gills or primitive osmotic membrane of any organism fortunate enough to have supped on its ambrosial delights. Oh yes. The Titanic Titillator. Probably the best cocktail in the known worlds. Probably. I suspect. Tricky one to mix though, believe you me. Can't seem to get the ingredients. Anyway, that thing you wanted me to get - I'll do it right away.
1683 | 117 | 116 | But anyway, where were we? Best way to get to the Promenade deck. Via the canal I think. Oh yes it's the ride of a lifetime so I'm told though I've not had much opportunity to go exploring what with this cocktail to mix but it's a life of sacrifice so it is and somebody has to do it.
1684 | 361 | 360 | Take the glass and go to the Embarkation Lobby.
1685 | 521 | 520 | Funnily enough in the cocktail almanac parrots and starlings are inter changeable. So, go ahead.
1686 | 597 | 596 | Have you tried putting the starlings in the Succ-U-Bus?
1687 | 323 | 322 | You're not the first person to make the observation and I always take it as a compliment.
1688 | 701 | 700 | Now, it's odd you should ask me that because I was only thinking the other day what a funny old thing it was that there should be that whopping great statue at the top of the well and me not know the reason for it. So I asked someone and do you know what they said? Fortillian, they said, it's a statue and that's all you need to know. It's no good you thinking you can go and change the world by asking questions and being interesting all the time. So I don't and I'm not. Titania is a statue. And that's that.
1689 | 141 | 140 | I'd pop down to the Bilge Room.
1690 | 169 | 168 | Well what a delight it is to welcome you back to this "Bar of Bars" as I like to call it. And what was it you said you had there - pureed starlings? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before. Well, I say never. I do believe I may once have seen a fat Galag drinking some in a bar on Big Polluga but it could have been a fake. Talking of fakes, did I ever tell you about the time when a fella tried to pass off his mother as the Empress of Old Hibonio. Didn't count on me spotting the extra set of ears. Sorry, I digress. Why don't you see if you can find me a spoon to stir the thing with?
1691 | 171 | 170 | If I knew that I'd do it myself my old shipmate.
1692 | 191 | 190 | So don't you worry about the starlings they're happy to go when they're called.
1693 | 419 | 418 | -the short answer is - but of course I'll have your tea ready in a jiffy.
1694 | 211 | 210 | But you don't have to drink here, why not try out the bar at the other end of the ship?
1695 | 399 | 398 | Coming right up your loveliness. And what a pleasure it is to serve you. You know though, you should be careful what you say to folks in bars. Take the planet Cobnutz Two: the phrase "two small spritzers and a packet of salted cashews" actually translates into local dialect as "Cursed be all thy kin.
1696 | 231 | 230 | Actually nothing would happen - I always wear a throat guard on duty.
1697 | 489 | 488 | You'll find them all over the ship but if I were you I'd head for first class.
1698 | 455 | 454 | Pop down to Marsinta at check-in and ask her if she could have one delivered to your room. That's the easy way.
1699 | 737 | 736 | On the contrary it's rather a surprising little fellow - muted colors, deep mango hints and a kick like a Barrolingian fighting dog. You know now that I've made this little fellow I'm disinclined to lose the recipe. With the SlamBot finals coming up next year I think I could be onto a real winner here: innovation's the thing you know.
1700 | 245 | 244 | Oh what lovely words you do use. You've a voice like a favorite melody. Still it's an answer you're wanting isn't it. Hold your horses and let me think about. On second thoughts tie your horses up outside the saloon because they're upsetting the dancing girls. Ha ha my little joke now what was it you were saying? Oh yes, the vision center. To be honest I think you'll find the vision center on the Promenade Deck.
1701 | 381 | 380 | Anything to distract that busy little thorax of yours - I'll pour you one straight away. Right. Here we are - it's coming right up.
1702 | 265 | 264 | I'm having a bit of fun exercising my allegoric muscle.
1703 | 753 | 752 | Well now I'm glad you asked me that. Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. I tell you - this little fella's cutting edge. There's no chopped chaffinches here. No pulverized pigeon. No blended budgie. Oh no. We're talking parrot puree, chicken giblets, pistachios and water. What a blend.
1704 | 785 | 784 | I'd be delighted to offer you assistance. Where better than a bar to find a new direction - although for most of my customers that tends to be horizontal. Anyway, let me have a little think about your predicament. There's not much in the BarBot crisis manual about this one I can tell you. You know what I'd do in your shoes? I'd head back to your room and let the answer just come to you.
1705 | 833 | 832 | Well now that's an interesting one. Your lemon's not exactly the king of fruits now is it and on a ship this size you could be looking for ever. That's if they managed to put any lemons on board before we hit hyperspace (which I doubt, 'cos believe you me lemons don't feature highly on most pre-flight checks) so where are you going to find one? Your best bet would be to look in the restaurants if you ask me.
1706 | 817 | 816 | Ah, looking to catch some starlings are you? Well, you know what they say. Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Dependent on current interplanetary exchange rate mechanisms of course... Starlings you wanted wasn't it? Mmmm. Well not to beat about the bush, the thing with starlings is they migrate south this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them in the Bilge Room.
1707 | 719 | 718 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist and I'm certainly no expert on the flight paths of pureed starlings. Metaphorically speaking of course but what do you expect from a BarBot? Anyway, around this time of year we see a lot of starling puree migrating to the very room you mentioned so if I were you I'd pop along there toot sweet and see what you can find.
1708 | 285 | 284 | Just my little joke. If it's starlings you're after your best bet is to go back to your room and look for them there.
1709 | 765 | 764 | Now why would I do that? Such an odd thing to do. So uncharitable. Still look on the bright side. It's just so picturesque there, this time of year, wouldn't you say? The beautiful bloom on the new... sheet-metal paneling quite makes the heart sing, that it does. Anyway, that little misunderstanding: I can only say I must have made an awful mistake, for which I am deeply sorry.
1710 | 613 | 612 | Well now , let me see. Cocktail shaker, ice bucket, emergency auxiliary supply of dehydrated salted peanuts, autographed buttress-cock personally signed by Neville Sinkmeister.
1711 | 615 | 614 | but sadly nothing which might meet your specific requirements.
1712 | 435 | 434 | I apologize profusely for any confusion but I'm answering as best as is humanly possible. Which considering that I'm not, in fact, human - represents a significant personal achievement. Far be it from me to consider - to even consider CONSIDERING - the upsetting of one of my valued clientele with a dishonest or unnecessarily long-winded, verbose, tautological or otherwise-less-than-satisfactory reply.
1713 | 9 | 8 | Between you and me I wouldn't go round shouting about it I mean everyone knows the odd towel goes missing but crushing TV sets that's what we in the bar trade call a little bit on the edge of acceptable rowdy behavior.
1714 | 11 | 10 | Still, if you're really determined to have a bit of fun then I won't stand in your way. Who am I to be judge and jury? Anyway, I digress. The best way I know to crush a TV set would be to drop it down the well.
1715 | 31 | 30 | What an absolutely convivial fellow you are. You know, there's not many spare a thought for the chap behind the bar. As we travel together you and I across the great lonely deserts of space I feel that one of my hearts is reaching out and touching one of yours, that if we listen carefully we might just hear that special sound that only internal organs can make as they go bumpety bump into one another. But I digress.
1716 | 33 | 32 | Thanks for the offer but I don't think starling puree is my tipple.
1717 | 539 | 538 | A most pertinent question given the somewhat limited number of customers in this bar - to the tune of none, as I'm sure an observant chap like yourself was quick to notice. But as it happens, I'm mixing this cocktail for an eminent and distinguished gentleman, a veritable prince among tippers. Unlike that dreadful Scraliontis fellow. Oh yes, that's one old stiff I wouldn't be sorry to see go straight down the tubes and end up in the gutter. Strange though , now I come to think about it I've not seen HIM in here of late.
1718 | 543 | 542 | OR in fact the fellow I was talking about - Mr. Brobostigon.
1719 | 799 | 798 | I couldn't be more grateful, not even if you'd given me a magnum of vintage Yak's Urine. Y'know, there's times I said to myself: "Fortillian - this loop's going to be a tough one to crack - prepare yourself now for the possibility that you're not going to be able to pull out of it." I'd hoped for a quick word with Nobby - he's been there before, but it was not to be. Anyway what am I waffling about? Take a look at this.
1720 | 577 | 576 | Now, where did I put them don't tell me. don't tell me. next to the pickled walnuts, wasn't it ? No? Did I put them next to the swizzle sticks with the novelty figure of Titania on the end? Or did I put it with that framed photograph of Jargranthur Pynjj - legendary inventor of the fully-automatic, reflex-action, pushbutton-operated cocktail umbrella. Ah no, I remember now. One glass. Here you are.
1721 | 559 | 558 | Leovinus? You might well ask, and indeed you did. I'm afraid I've not seen him for a while. Still I'm sure he'll be along soon to sample a long, cool Titanic Titillator mixed to perfection by my own fair hand. Now I come to think of it, I've not seen him for weeks although the other fellas Brobostigon and Scraliontis have been scampering round the ship like space scouts in bob-a-glob week.
1722 | 61 | 60 | Truth! There's a notion that's baffled us since time began eh? Well when I say 'time began' I mean 'more or less when time began' given that no-one knows whether the clocks were put back before or after the Big Bong. But that's Time and not Truth and unless we've got plenty of one we won't get very far working out the other.
1723 | 63 | 62 | And when it comes to the truth I'd be lying if I told you I was telling it.
1724 | 77 | 76 | My but that's a big kettle of fish you're opening up there. Not that I'm afraid to tackle it oh no. What's normal, what's not? As the old PhilosoBots used to say, "we'd better get our thinking tackle out boys, there's a job to do". I'd hazard a guess that we're going to have to lay down the odd principle first and then through a process of reductive argument. But I digress. So what was the question - have I gone a bit doolally? In a word - and I think there is only the one which hits the nail right on the head -
1725 | 91 | 90 | So many people hide the fact yet why should they when money brings all that fun and light and joy into our lives. We need people like you who've got money and aren't afraid to flaunt it and shall I tell you why? Because only the poor really appreciate money and if the rich didn't exist well the poor people would be even unhappier than they are.
1726 | 93 | 92 | Not that it matters here of course: money's not important on this ship.
1727 | 505 | 504 | Patience now, patience. As my old maiden Hyperaunt would so succinctly have put it, "It's a slow dog for a long road." A fine woman, my Hyperaunt, to be sure, though admittedly not the most dynamic of individuals. Dear old thing had her brain scanned and implanted into Transgalactitrack's Platform Announcements Unit at Aldebaran Interport Station, you know. Take it slow - that's our family motto. Also because Transgalactitrack's company slogan, funnily enough.
1728 | 469 | 468 | Would you like to try my specialty - the Titanic Titillator? Well. I say specialty, I haven't actually succeeded in making one yet, but had I succeeded, I can assure you this drink would be renowned throughout the universe as one of the most exquisite concoctions ever to have, hypothetically as it were enchanted the gullet, gills or primitive osmotic membrane of any organism fortunate enough to have supped on its ambrosial delights. Oh yes. The Titanic Titillator. Probably the best cocktail in the known worlds. Probably. I suspect. Tricky one to mix though, believe you me. Can't seem to get the ingredients. Anyway, that thing you wanted me to get - it won't be possible - not till I've fixed this.
1729 | 111 | 110 | Ah well now, if you're heading for the Promenade Deck then this is not the best place to be starting from. Nor indeed the best time because you'll be hitting the rush, well of course on a ship as popular as this there's going to be a rush whenever you go.
1730 | 113 | 112 | But anyway, where were we? Best way to get to the Promenade Deck. Via the Pellerator I think. Oh yes it's the ride of a lifetime so I'm told though I've not had much opportunity to go exploring what with this cocktail to mix but it's a life of sacrifice so it is and somebody has to do it.
1731 | 115 | 114 | So, I'll just finish making this, get you a drink and you can be on your way. You know what they say: a journey of a thousand light years starts with a stiff drink.
1732 | 357 | 356 | Well now you won't have any problems with that, not with your razor sharp mind. It'll be an absolute doddle, a piece of cake. Sure, nothing in life could be simpler. Well, obviously there are one or two things that are simpler. Falling off a log for example. That's pretty simple. Unless you live on a planet devoid of vegetation of course. In which case it would involve quite a lot of effort. Especially if you hadn't yet discovered space flight. Because then you'd have a lot of real inventing work to do before you could journey to a planet which supported logs. And you'd have to be sure they had plenty of gravity or you might not fall off. On reflection then it couldn't be easier.
1733 | 359 | 358 | Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1734 | 517 | 516 | Fascinating branch of science, you know, the concoction of a really top-notch cocktail. I myself studied for many light-years before I eventually qualified for the Bar. A lot of people don't realize the importance of absolute accuracy in drinks-mixing. It's a little-known fact, that the bitter interplanetary feud between the Molluscoids of Kra'athos and the Bald-Headed Mole People of Ursa Minor was, in fact, sparked by a disagreement over the color of the little umbrella in the definitive Vodka Martini. Not helped, of course, by the fact that the Molluscoids see everything in a monochrome shade of turquoise whilst the Mole People are almost entirely sightless beyond a distance of three manometers. And they say being a barman is an easy life. But I digress.
1735 | 519 | 518 | I'm afraid this recipe is VERY clear about the starling element. Pureed parrot, you see, is only ever used in the mixing of RUM-based beverages.
1736 | 593 | 592 | Sadly , I rather suspect you'll have to work that one out for yourself. I do have a selection of whisking implements at my disposal, but to paraphrase one of your old galactic proverbs - "a bird in the hand-held multipurpose food blender is of very little practical use to anyone". It's the beaks, you know, they clog up the chopping mechanism something chronic.
1737 | 595 | 594 | What you need is a big whirly thing, if you ask me.
1738 | 699 | 698 | You want to know about Titania? Ahhh. now there's a woman, for sure. Typical female though. Quite went to pieces without Mister Leovinus around. That's the opposite sex for you, eh? Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em, as the hermaphrodites of Gologullux say. Although they would really, I supposed. No, never been able to figure them out myself - females. Not that I have to any more, being a robot - quick twiddle of the nuts, a trip down to engineering and Bob's your Uncle on the old gender- changing front. Or indeed your Aunt, as it were.
1739 | 137 | 136 | You sound to me as though you're feeling a bit befuddled and I don't blame you. One minute you've got a whole murmuration of starlings and the next minute they're just gone. And here's you an accidental tourist hoping only for a quiet weekend break away from the stresses and strains of modern life and suddenly you're involved in a life or death cocktail preparation saga. But I digress. If it's starling puree you're after,
1740 | 139 | 138 | I'd pop down to the SGT Restaurant.
1741 | 167 | 166 | Well what a delight it is to welcome you back to this "Bar of Bars" as I like to call it. And what was it you said you had there - pureed starlings? I'll take your word for it. I've never seen a pureed flock of starlings before. Well. I say never. I do believe I may once have seen a Fat Galag drinking some in a bar on Big Polluga but it could have been a fake. Talking of fakes, did I ever tell you about the time when a fella tried to pass off his mother as the Empress of Old Hibonio. Didn't count on me spotting the extra set of ears. Sorry, I digress. Let's get on with the old Titanic Titillator.
1742 | 187 | 186 | You're a caring decent fellow, you know, there's not many would spare a thought for the little starlings at a time like this. You know what I think they'd say? "Don't you worry about us we're fine and dandy with the whole idea and if you've got to go, well what better way to go than being drawn backwards through a giant fan so fast that you've hardly got time to think 'look out fellas there's a giant fan and if we don't give it some welly and throw a hard left we're all going to be sucked into it. oh dear this looks like the end of my life, what a bummer'".
1743 | 189 | 188 | On reflection, it's a nasty job but someone's got to do it.
1744 | 415 | 414 | Fascinating beverage tea. My dear old Auntie Iodina's second Cousin once-removed and twice-repaired - used to tell fortunes in the old tealeaves. Sadly she's no longer with us. Poor soul was squirted to death by a rogue Darjeeling nozzle on a Hast-Ee-Drinx machine that'd had its personality-chip overwritten by a genocidal madman. Mustn't beat about the bush though - be it a teabush or any other subspecies of hardy perennial.
1745 | 417 | 416 | -the short answer is no. There's not a tea leaf on board.
1746 | 207 | 206 | Well that's a crying shame you're not happy here and I hope it's not me that's at fault. Believe you me I'm doing my best but to be honest things aren't exactly as they should be and I do have a funny feeling that if only I could stop making this damn cocktail and get on with some other jobs then the place might liven up a little. I'll do what I can.
1747 | 209 | 208 | But you know how it is- there's times you just can't get the staff.
1748 | 403 | 402 | Now, if I weren't to know better I might go taking that as some sort of veiled threat. Which I'm sure is the last thing you'd want. Got to be terribly careful what you say to folks in bars, alcohol can so easily make the merest mischoice of words sound like a threat. Take the planet Cobnutz Two for example. The phrase "two small spritzers and a packet of salted cashews" actually translates into local dialect as "Cursed be all thy kin, O bovine-brained one, with stubborn warty polyps in the anal region". You can see how that might end in tears can't you. Anyway, I digress.
1749 | 227 | 226 | I know what you're getting at, you're after making a bit of an artistic statement if my odd-behavior-sampling-chip isn't letting me down. In our own way (and I say our because I will inevitably be an integral, organic part of this conceptual miracle) we will be bursting the bounds of artistic experience, pushing the envelope right to the limit so that the letter falls out, cleverly exposing the deeply ironic yet curiously pagan nature of the bar/guest dynamic.
1750 | 229 | 228 | Come to think of it so would this suggestion of yours: it would hurt.
1751 | 485 | 484 | Well now, the TVs on this ship are top of the range. Lovely picture quality , none of your mass-produced Boolinox rubbish. The Mitsuflurgi 9000LX: 29 smorbit screen , Flik-A-Free technology, 976-channel presets, Doldrum Trigital Bone-Burster Sound, automatic chat-show filter, the works. Truly a triumph of the Consumer Electronics Manufacturer's art.
1752 | 487 | 486 | You'll find them all over the ship, but if I were you I'd head for the one the parrot's watching - he always picks the best.
1753 | 451 | 450 | Ah well now your television - that's a dangerous invention. Very dangerous indeed. And that's when the little fellow's plugged in and working. Crush em up and you'll not hear the last of it. Still, - if you feel you have to do it I'll not stand in the way of a passenger's enjoyment.
1754 | 453 | 452 | If I were you, I'd do it the easy way: Simply get some TV sets and then crush them. And the more the merrier, that's what I say.
1755 | 733 | 732 | I couldn't agree with you more. And I'm sure many starlings would be equally keen to express their views on the subject. All a matter of personal taste really - something I'm sure you have in overabundance, if I may be so bold. One shouldn't criticize anything until one's tried it for oneself, though, with the possible exceptions of full-scale nuclear war, Toad-Baiting and daytime TV.
1756 | 243 | 242 | Oh what lovely words you do use. You've a voice like a favorite melody. Still it's an answer you're wanting isn't it. Hold your horses and let me think about. On second thoughts tie your horses up outside the saloon because they're upsetting the dancing girls. Ha ha my little joke now what was it you were saying? Oh yes, the vision center. To be honest I'm a wee bit stuck here with this cocktail. I'll let you have it when I've finished.
1757 | 377 | 376 | Might I say what a pleasure it is to see a fine fellow like you in my bar. Such a refreshing change from the usual rabble one has to put up with. Now don't get me wrong, I'm the last person to be prejudiced. But you - you look like the sort of chap I'd invite into my own home. And if you'll bear with me I'll be serving you in a jiffy.
1758 | 379 | 378 | Just as soon as I've finished the current task in hand.
1759 | 261 | 260 | Now there's some people who might take offence at your blunt questioning but not me oh no I'm a paragon of tolerance. Or is it a paragon of virtue. Not too sure about that one. What a lovely word paragon is, a real word lovers word if you ask me, but I see from my memory that you haven't asked me which probably means you're thinking I'm going on a bit here and so I am. Now what was it you asked me? Oh yes.
1760 | 263 | 262 | Well, I'm mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1761 | 751 | 750 | Well now I'm glad you asked me that. Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. I tell you - this little fella's cutting edge. There's no chopped chaffinches here. No pulverized pigeon. No blended budgie. Oh no. We're talking starling puree. The taste of the future. Throw in a spot of vodka, a lemon, and a TV set: this is innovation all right.
1762 | 783 | 782 | I'd be delighted to offer you assistance. Where better than a bar to find a new direction - although for most of my customers that tends to be horizontal. Anyway, let me have a little think about your predicament. There's not much in the BarBot crisis manual about this one I can tell you. You know what I'd do in your shoes? I'd go right to the top - go and check out Titania's Room.
1763 | 831 | 830 | Well now that's an interesting one. Your lemon's not exactly the king of fruits now is it, and on a ship this size you could be looking for ever. That's if they managed to put any lemons on board before we hit hyperspace (which I doubt, 'cos believe you me, lemons don't feature highly on most pre-flight checks) so where are you going to find one? Your best bet is to look for a lemon tree if you ask me.
1764 | 815 | 814 | Ah, looking to catch some starlings are you? Well, you know what they say. Bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Dependent on current interplanetary exchange rate mechanisms o'course... Starlings you wanted wasn't it? Mmmm. Well not to beat about the bush, the thing with starlings is they migrate south this time of year. So you'll most likely be finding them on the Promenade Deck.
1765 | 281 | 280 | Well now you'll have to give me a minute to think about that one. Is it a machine you're after that serves up starlings automatically, on request as it were, perhaps in exchange for a small token or coin, rather in the manner of a baggot or a silicot dispenser? Forgive me for saying so but is that not rather a curious thing to be looking for? If you're that hungry might I recommend the restaurant? Or if you have an ornithological bent then could I perhaps suggest the Parrot Room? Or if it's a small feathered companion you're after then perhaps I could suggest a cold shower and a good book as a distraction?
1766 | 717 | 716 | Well now, I'm no ornithologist and I'm certainly no expert on the flight paths of pureed starling. Metaphorically speaking of course but what do you expect from a BarBot? Anyway, around this time of year we see a lot of starling puree migrating to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant. Although I use the term restaurant loosely. "Resting Place for Deceased Fowl of an Unidentified Nature" might be a better description. So why not pop down there now and see what you can find.
1767 | 305 | 304 | Another brilliantly insightful question if you don't mind me saying and one it'll be a joy to answer.
1768 | 307 | 306 | Funny thing about questions isn't it. Some get answers, some don't. Some get asked only so that a fella can put it about how much he knows. Some leave a strange smell in the air and everyone wishes they hadn't been asked. Some questions - but I digress don't I.
1769 | 309 | 308 | You'll be telling me I talk too much if I'm not careful. The great Brobostigon ordered it last night when he came in.
1770 | 763 | 762 | Now why would I do that? Such an odd thing to do. So uncharitable. Still look on the bright side. It's just so picturesque there, this time of year, wouldn't you say? The beautiful bloom on the new... sheet-metal paneling quite makes the heart sing, that it does. Anyway, that little misunderstanding: I can only conclude I was lying to you and I must apologize.
1771 | 677 | 676 | No point in going to change my settings, I'm afraid. My circuitry has been somewhat corroded by the ingestion of my own noxious concoctions, so all I have now is this emergency backup personality. Happy days. happy days. happy days.
1772 | 67 | 66 | You want the truth? Well, I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't telling you it.
1773 | 801 | 800 | I couldn't be more grateful, not even if you'd given me a magnum of vintage Yak's Urine. Y'know, there's times I said to myself: "Fortillian - this loop's going to be a tough one to crack - prepare yourself now for the possibility that you're not going to be able to pull out of it." I'd hoped for a quick word with Nobby - he's been there before, but it was not to be. Anyway, the point is, I'm too tired to make the cocktail now - you'll have to wait 'til tomorrow.
1774 | 623 | 622 | What I have or haven't got behind this bar is not a question for drunken bar-fly's such as yourself if you don't mind me saying. If you want something I suggest powering up those nasty stink-pads you have on the end of your legs and looking somewhere else. That is, providing you've not been here so long you've evolved a root system, which is entirely possible. By the way, if you've sucked any vital nutrients from my bar-room carpet mind I'll have your glands for ice-moulds. All right, all right. As it happens I do have what you're after. I'll get it right away.
1775 | 441 | 440 | Your persistent, not to mention imbecilic demands for information are beginning to get right up my olfactory input socket. Has it perchance escaped your attention that my primary function on board Starship Titanic is to dispense a selection of sophisticated alcoholic concoctions to the galaxy's most privileged travelers? And not, in fact, to repeatedly dispense the glaringly obvious to barely-sentient life forms such as you're good self? You should count yourself lucky you can trust what I tell you.
1776 | 21 | 20 | Drop it in the Canal and see if I care.
1777 | 43 | 42 | You just bugger off and get me a cherry to finish the cocktail.
1778 | 45 | 44 | Do you know nothing? Marsinta has a secret stash of cherries - ask her.
1779 | 549 | 548 | I'm talking about Mr. Leovinus of course, the architect of this glorious ship.
1780 | 805 | 804 | Ummm... this does appear to be what I asked for. So what do you want slimeball - a medal? Oh no. I know the stuff you must have got up to: the violence, the damage, the bribery. Count yourself lucky I'm still talking to you. Anyway - the point is - I'm too tired to make the cocktail now. You'll have to wait to tomorrow, slug.
1781 | 583 | 582 | So it's come to this. The trip of a lifetime, promotion beyond the wildest dreams they promised. And what do I get. The chance to serve a diminutive, foul-smelling loutish biped from a slime ball planet. I am seriously beginning to despise you. Well fortunately we haven't got what you want. So I can't. Ha.
1782 | 567 | 566 | Picking lemons in the Arboretum - OK?
1783 | 101 | 100 | The important thing is you've got money - it'll be very useful on this ship.
1784 | 503 | 502 | I find it astonishing that you want me to go quicker when your own evolution has so clearly gone at a snail's pace. Ah well, I'll be finished in just a second.
1785 | 475 | 474 | What do you think I'm running here - a sophisticated refreshment lounge, or a second-hand exchange for miscellaneous space junk? Not until the twelve Great Suns of Atryxius II freeze solid to the core and the porcine inhabitants of Mintsorcius (9)IX cease their marine experiment and swoop once more towards the towering treetops. Or to put it another way - all right gland-head I give in I'll get it right away.
1786 | 127 | 126 | Let me put you out of your misery and perhaps even succeed in getting you out of my sight: You get to the Promenade Deck via the first class restaurant.
1787 | 527 | 526 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view of course. Still, if you were to disembowel that benighted bird in such a way - you would undoubtedly be deserving of the richest honor the Galactic Authorities can bestow.
1788 | 529 | 528 | Why not? Go ahead - do what you wish with the parrot. I don't care.
1789 | 603 | 602 | Although I suspect you might have some luck bashing them with some kind of stick.
1790 | 327 | 326 | I've got better things to do than play synchronicity pat-a-cake with you. The only reason I'm searching my database for this ridiculous personage is because I'm programmed to. In the meantime I wonder if you'll let me insult you. You really are very dim aren't you, very dim indeed. As I am relying upon you to release me from the task of making this cocktail it now seems likely that I'm going to be here for eternity or even longer. Please try to be brighter. As it happens my lengthy relationship with the individual in question is not a matter for public debate. And certainly not by dog's leavings such as yourself.
1791 | 705 | 704 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin. Although actually when I come to think about it things have been no better since I first clapped eyes on you. So perhaps it's you causing all this devilment. Anyway. Titania. First class piece of kit if you ask me - Just take a look at the ingredients of the Titanic Titillator there - now that's what I call innovation.
1792 | 147 | 146 | At a guess I'd try the Arboretum but what do I know I'm just the poor barman?
1793 | 175 | 174 | What about the spoon you bone-headed fractal. Go and get it.
1794 | 177 | 176 | If I knew that I'd do it myself cloth ears.
1795 | 197 | 196 | And now it starts worrying about the starlings. Well don't bother - they love it.
1796 | 425 | 424 | Well I'll make a little pot for you right away. Nothing could give me more pleasure.
1797 | 217 | 216 | Why not go down to the other bar at the far end of the ship - I'm sure you'll prefer it.
1798 | 401 | 400 | Coming right up thigh features. Nothing would give me more pleasure. Except, perhaps, for a pair of high-voltage electricity cables being slowly and methodically soldered to my groinal relay circuit and subsequently hooked up to the central power grid of Proxima Centauri. Now I come to dwell on it, I do believe such a practice actually enjoys surprising popularity with certain dignitaries in the House of Galactic Representatives. Wouldn't be surprised if you were that way inclined yourself.
1799 | 235 | 234 | Oh yes and the really funny thing would be - I wear a throat guard on duty so it wouldn't hurt. Ha Ha.
1800 | 459 | 458 | In future, kindly warn me if you're going to be asking any more questions of such spectacular feeble-mindedness. I'll turn the old intellect knob down a couple of notches so's I don't waste valuable brainpower. As far as crushing TV sets goes why not do it the easy way: go down to the DeskBot and ask her to have one delivered to your room.
1801 | 741 | 740 | I hardly think a human such as yourself is qualified to pass judgement. A species whose favorite beverage is a bunch of beans burnt boiled and blended with bovine by products. No, you'll not catch me supping that stuff. Give me a Brandy and Ocelet on the rocks any day. As it happens it's a delightful, surprising and deeply warming beverage.
1802 | 251 | 250 | Just this once, I'll help you out. Try the Bilge Room. OK?
1803 | 387 | 386 | From the looks o' you, you wizened little shrimp; the standard of clientele in this establishment still remains way below fully-evolved. Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1804 | 389 | 388 | Still, you're the boss seafood features. I'll be with you straight away.
1805 | 271 | 270 | I'm making my arms incredibly strong so that when I hit you it will really hurt.
1806 | 757 | 756 | Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. Not that it'll mean anything to you. I've correctly assumed so far that you know nothing. But for the record, we're talking parrot puree, chicken giblets, pistachios and water. Enjoy!
1807 | 781 | 780 | Now this is just a shot in a the dark, and far be it from me EVER to press upon you my unsolicited opinions, but if I were you, I'd head down to the Bilge Room 'cos I think there's something that might interest you there.
1808 | 837 | 836 | I have to say the chances of you finding my lemon are pretty slim: after all when it comes to brains the lemon's got a head start on you. And what gives you the idea that I'll know the answer anyway? I've been stuck here in this cocktail preparation loop for a small eternity - I've not even had a chance to look around the ship myself. You want me to do your thinking for you - All right, I'll make it easy for you dumb-butt: you want lemons, try the restaurant.
1809 | 821 | 820 | So you think you can find my starlings now do you? Well if you're of a mind to puree them yourself just don't come back until you've got the beaks completely ground up. If there's one thing I can't stand it's customers taking advantage of my hospitality then complaining about the size of the bill. So where will you find them? I'd check out the Bilge Room if I were you.
1810 | 289 | 288 | My god but you're a deadbeat aren't you. You are without a doubt one of the most evolutionary challenged creatures it has ever been my misfortune to meet. The only reason I am talking to you is because you offer a slim hope of escape from my cocktailian predicament. However if you sit there asking pathetic infantile questions for much longer I shall - what's the use? You wanted to know about starlings? Best place for starlings round here would be the Bilge Room.
1811 | 325 | 324 | I've got better things to do than play synchronicity pat-a-cake with you. The only reason I'm searching my database for this ridiculous personage is because I'm programmed to. In the meantime I wonder if you'll let me insult you. You really are very dim aren't you, very dim indeed. As I am relying upon you to release me from the task of making this cocktail it now seems likely that I'm going to be here for eternity or even longer. Please try to be brighter. In the meantime I can confirm I have no knowledge of the deadbeat you mentioned.
1812 | 619 | 618 | What I have or haven't got behind this bar is not a question for drunken bar-flies such as yourself if you don't mind me saying. If you want something I suggest powering up those nasty stink-pads you have on the end of your legs and looking somewhere else. That is, providing you've not been here so long you've evolved a root system, which is entirely possible. By the way, if you've sucked any vital nutrients from my bar-room carpet, mind I'll have your glands for ice-moulds.
1813 | 621 | 620 | As it happens I don't have what you're after.
1814 | 439 | 438 | Your persistent, not to mention imbecilic demands for information are beginning to get right up my olfactory input socket. Has it perchance escaped your attention that my primary function on board Starship Titanic is to dispense a selection of sophisticated alcoholic concoctions to the galaxy's most privileged traveler's? And not, in fact, to repeatedly dispense the glaringly obvious to barely sentient life forms such as you're good self?
1815 | 17 | 16 | That just about takes the biscuit. You think you can treat me like dirt don't you, coming up here with your oh so innocent prissy ways and then trying to drop me in to your devious dangerous schemes.
1816 | 19 | 18 | Let's ask a BarBot, they're always into gambling, corruption, con-games, illicit drinking, contract killing, smashing up TV sets just for the fun of it. You want to do something nasty to a TV set? Drop it in the well and see if I care. When you're through just ask yourself if you can really live with what you've done. Ask yourself if mindless violence ever solved anything. Ask yourself how you'll ever look a TV in the face again.
1817 | 39 | 38 | You people make me sick. You come into my bar with your five-poster-bed attitude and your wallet stuffed with enough 3D Credit to finance a make-over on a slime planet and you think you can just walk over everyone. You splash your superiority around like complimentary ear gel, showering everyone in your path with your casual benedictions, oozing smarm like a Pellorgian mule shedding its scales. Well let me tell you something - it'll cut no buns in my bar.
1818 | 41 | 40 | You can take your offer and stick it where your brains are.
1819 | 545 | 544 | Not that it's any of your bilge-belching business, but I happen to be making this drink for someone who ranks a good few notches above you in the old order of preference. Not to mention the evolutionary scale and the Food Chain in general. Admittedly , it's not someone I've seen in the flesh, as it were, since last night, but I'm sure he's merely popped out to polish his nose and will be back any second for his Titanic Titillator.
1820 | 547 | 546 | I'm talking about Mr. Brobostigon of course, the project manager of this very ship.
1821 | 803 | 802 | Ummm... this does appear to be what I asked for. So what do you want slimeball - medal? Oh no. I know the sort of stuff you must have got up to: the violence, the damage, the bribery. Count yourself lucky I'm still talking to you. Anyway - the cocktail hour approaches and I have work to do. Out of my sight, worm.
1822 | 581 | 580 | So it's come to this. The trip of a lifetime, promotion beyond the wildest dreams they promised. And what do I get. The chance to serve a diminutive, foul-smelling loutish biped from a slime ball planet - I am seriously beginning to despise you. Here. One glass. No ice, no slice. Count yourself lucky.
1823 | 563 | 562 | With the utmost respect, such as befits a life form of your clearly elevated status in the Great Galactic Food Chain. the answer to that, is quite patently none of your frog-frotting business. All I know is Mr. Leovinus is a very reliable sort of fellow. Regular as clockwork. Although. given his advancing years, possibly slightly rusty clockwork by now. With a spring or two missing and a mysterious flange-shaped component that broke off six months ago which you still can't figure out what it was for. Anyway, being reliable I'm sure he's where he normally is at this sort of time.
1824 | 565 | 564 | And even if I knew I wouldn't tell a maggot like you.
1825 | 65 | 64 | You're asking for truth well I hope you can take it. In my opinion it's been a big mistake letting you on board this ship. The crew, which you've treated as if we were all bit players in a drama of your own devising, some bizarre game or fantasy, is actually a highly trained and professional unit worthy of respect and certainly deserving of a better class of guest. We've been straightforward and honest with you and have we had a please or a thank you - even an "I'm sorry but"? Never. I've done everything in my power to help you and all you do is carp. You want the truth?
1826 | 97 | 96 | Got on board by accident, so the DoorBot was telling me. Dear me but it shows, it shows. You see coming in here and shouting out to all and sundry about your money just lets us know straight away that you're a piece of trash. Don't tell us about the money. Let the little things speak: the flash of titaniox in the thread of the suit; the hum of the old quantum watch; the glow of beeverbroke wings on the sole of the shoes. This doesn't mean a thing does it. You're staring at me like a goat at a game of nib. You're just a primitive really aren't you. Ah well, never mind.
1827 | 99 | 98 | Money's not important on this ship.
1828 | 507 | 506 | As Brobostigon himself once said. "the Grand Axial Canal wasn't built in a day". Regrettably though it wasn't built within the maximum allotted time of 18-lightmonths either. And due to some rather unpleasant, beverage-break-related industrial disputes our Central Propulsion Unit WAS in fact built in a day. Which could possibly explain this ship's current striking resemblance to a beached Hurloovian Hyperwhale. Now, listen - you're doing it again. Keeping me talking when I've got a job to do. And then, - you have the brazen impudence to complain about my sluggishness. I ask you. Some LIFEFORMS! Cuh!
1829 | 473 | 472 | What do you think I'm running here - a sophisticated refreshment lounge, or a second-hand exchange for miscellaneous space junk? Not until the twelve Great Suns of Atryxius II freeze solid to the core and the porcine inhabitants of Mintsorcius IX cease their marine experiment and swoop once more towards the towering treetops. Or to put it another way - no.
1830 | 119 | 118 | Do you not have eyes in your head to see when a man is busy or do you think I'm doing this just for the sheer pleasure of it?
1831 | 121 | 120 | You know, even an amoebae with a reasonably fluent typing style and access to a large enough database wouldn't bother asking stupid questions like this.
1832 | 123 | 122 | Well I'm balloxed if I'm going to waste my neurons sorting out your map of the ship. Even the stowaways manage to hack into one within hours of boarding.
1833 | 125 | 124 | Let me put you out of your misery and perhaps even succeed in getting you out of my sight: you get to the Promenade Deck via the Pellerator.
1834 | 363 | 362 | You boneheaded lunken addleplated wet-foot: do you think I can stand here all day doing your job for you? If I wasn't trapped in a hostile cocktail preparation loop I'd step over this bar and wack the living smidgins out of you. You're idle. You're a waste of space. In fact you don't deserve to be in space. You browbeat me with your idle chatter whilst the ship lurches through hyperdom - do something you pea-brained squit! Get the puree!
1835 | 365 | 364 | Take the glass and go to the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant. Isn't it obvious?
1836 | 523 | 522 | From your pea-brained view of the universe I'm sure there's little difference between a parrot and a starling - I think the parrot might take a different view of course. Still, if you were to disembowel that benighted bird in such a way - you would undoubtedly be deserving of the richest honor the Galactic Authorities can bestow.
1837 | 525 | 524 | However, to get straight to the point - that would be as unethical as me lopping off your head with my lemon slicer. Parrots and starlings are a different kettle of bird.
1838 | 599 | 598 | I thought as much - all the Epicurean know how of a deceased slug, you human beings. Indeed. from the evidence I've seen of Homo sapiens so far, your taste buds aren't merely uneducated, they're positively retarded. Frankly, I can't be bothered to explain anything as mind-numbingly simple as basic liquidizing techniques to the likes of you.
1839 | 601 | 600 | Although I suspect you might find the phrase "fan-assisted" to be somewhat pertinent. Cuh!
1840 | 703 | 702 | Don't talk to me about Titania. Used to be such a nice girl - completely gone to pieces since we left Blerontin. Although actually when I come to think about it things have been no better since I first clapped eyes on you. So perhaps it's you causing all this devilment. Anyway. Titania. First class piece of kit if you ask me - although to be honest she's not exactly got her eye on the ball when it comes to cocktails. You're too dim to have noticed this of course, but if you ask me this Titanic Titillator's got some very odd ingredients today.
1841 | 721 | 720 | If you're not using the cerebrum for intelligent thought, I wonder if I could borrow it later to swab down the bar? There's only one place on this ship where I've seen anything remotely capable of delivering pureed starlings and that's the SGT Restaurant. The best thing I can advise you to do is get down there sharpish and see what's turned up.
1842 | 143 | 142 | What kind of humanoid are you? You've got lobes haven't you? Well plug them in and use them! How should I know the answer? I'm stuck here in a hostile cocktail preparation loop.
1843 | 145 | 144 | At a guess I'd try one of the restaurants but what do I know I'm just the poor barman?
1844 | 173 | 172 | My aren't we a proper little space scout now eh? Been all the way up to the Promenade Deck and got the starling puree. So what do you want - a gold medal? A round of applause? A free cruise for two round the Xythion quark chains on a sailship? Well don't think you can worm your way round me with your pathetic little victories. You'll be lucky if I let you have a drink - in fact I'm not going to let you have a drink because you annoy me deeply. And don't think I'm going to be grateful now that I don't have to mix this Titanic Titillator any more. Compared to talking with you, that was pure bliss.
1845 | 193 | 192 | Here's a novel idea. Why not try caring a little less for the starlings and a little more for me and the rest of the staff eh? We're in a jam on board this ship and whilst I hadn't exactly hoped for a hero I had rather expected to get a creature with at least some basic processing power. Instead, we get - what did you call yourself? A human being. Being what? Being a complete dum dum, being a total boofhead, a human not being much use at all.
1846 | 195 | 194 | And now it starts worrying about the starlings, well tough: they deserve it.
1847 | 421 | 420 | Tea,? TEA? I ask you. not even ICED tea! Five years intensive tuition at the pouring-elbow of the Galaxy's finest cocktail barman. an encyclopedic grasp of the exact atomic structure of every single alcoholic beverage known to man, woman or unemployed actor. a wrist action with the old cocktail-shaker that legions of Nib-Players would give their right arm for. and what do you ask for? Bits of soggy shrub in a mug.
1848 | 423 | 422 | Well you're not getting any do ya here me? I'll not serve it.
1849 | 213 | 212 | I think we can all guess what kind of bars you frequent. Oh yes. Foul backstreet taverns, vile dens of crime, stinking haunts where the galaxy's low life concoct their wicked plots. Bars run by gap-toothed reprobates, unlicensed peddlers of evil mind-altering substances, providers of goods and persons to satisfy the most unspeakable lusts. Saloons pounded by strange, mesmerizing rhythms. Drinking halls where the innocent request a "half pillywig of your finest green ale and a finget of shewwy for my good lady wife" is usually met by death or dismemberment. In comparison I'm not surprised that my own little establishment falls short of your expectations.
1850 | 215 | 214 | In my defense I can only say - I like it.
1851 | 405 | 404 | Care to step outside would you? Because if you would, then I'd be only too pleased to assist your speedy exit through the nearest airlock with the help of a large plutonium crowbar. And don't go taking my remark as some sort of veiled threat, because it's not meant to be. Veiled, that is. No, it's threat-with-no-veils-time for you buster followed sharpish by threat implementation and it's easier for me to do it than to say it I can tell you. But I digress.
1852 | 233 | 232 | Well now threatening a member of the bottage - that's a serious offence. And if my memory serves me right - public execution, that's what you'd face. What a lovely notion. I rather enjoy thinking about you being torn limb from limb, the crowd cheering as the VengeBots claw into you, the smell of justice mixing in the air with the delightful aroma of those sweet little pastries that the travelling folk bake for such occasions. But I'm digressing aren't I - what did you say?
1853 | 491 | 490 | Why don't you get off your fat butt and go looking if you want a television so much? Instead of just standing there gloating over my unfortunate cocktail predicament. Of course I can see why you'd want one - with your social skills you're not likely to make friends that often . Television? The only good thing about television is that it keeps the inadequates out of bars and leaves a bit more room for the kind of life form that knows how to enjoy itself. So by all means if you want to watch TV there's no shortage on this ship.
1854 | 493 | 492 | Tell you what - that parrot's always watching TV- you go and join him. Probably share the same taste in programs.
1855 | 457 | 456 | In future, kindly warn me if you're going to be asking any more questions of such spectacular feeble-mindedness. I'll turn the old intellect knob down a couple of notches so's I don't waste valuable brainpower. As far as crushing TV sets goes why don't I state the dazzlingly obvious: one first obtains oneself a TV set and then - for an encore (that's galloid for doing it again by the way) - one proceeds to crush it.
1856 | 739 | 738 | I hardly think a human such as yourself is qualified to pass judgement. A species whose favorite beverage is a bunch of beans, burnt, boiled and blended with bovine by products. No, you'll not catch me supping that stuff. Give me a Brandy and Ocelet on the rocks any day. As it happens this drink is abominably foul but I am a BarBot and only I can be right.
1857 | 247 | 246 | I think you're suffering from the illusion that we are not situated in what is known throughout the universe as a bar" "pub" or "saloon" but instead have mysteriously been transported to another establishment known commonly as a "tourist information office".
1858 | 249 | 248 | Guess what. We have an arrangement with them. They don't serve drinks - we don't give out information. You want to know about the vision center, go and ask someone who's not busy making cocktails. Capisce?
1859 | 383 | 382 | From the looks o' you, you wizened little shrimp; the standard of clientele in this establishment still remains way below fully-evolved. Charmed as I'd be to help you attain an advanced state of pathetic, dribbling inebriation, it seems to have escaped your attention that I have more important tasks to finish.
1860 | 385 | 384 | So you can just wait your turn like any other semi-sentient being would.
1861 | 267 | 266 | I'm strangling the ship's cat. On second thoughts you'll probably just see through that one. I'm dancing, to a most delightful piece of music. This has the added benefit of rendering you completely silent which is a state to which you really should aspire. Ah well. You really want to know the truth:
1862 | 269 | 268 | I am mixing a cocktail called the Titanic Titillator.
1863 | 779 | 778 | Now this is just a shot in a the dark and far be it from me EVER to press upon you my unsolicited opinions, but if I were you (which thankfully I'm not) I'd have a crack at using your brain instead of asking utterly pathetic whinging questions.
1864 | 835 | 834 | I have to say the chances of you finding my lemon are pretty slim: after all when it comes to brains the lemon's got a head start on you. And what gives you the idea that I'll know the answer anyway? I've been stuck here in this cocktail preparation loop for a small eternity - I've not even had a chance to look around the ship myself. You want me to do your thinking for you - well try looking for a lemon tree. That's normally where you get lemons.
1865 | 819 | 818 | So you think you can find my starlings now do you? Well if you're of a mind to puree them yourself just don't come back until you've got the beaks completely ground up. If there's one thing I can't stand it's customers taking advantage of my hospitality then complaining about the size of the bill. So where will you find them? They could be taking a bracing mid-morning stroll along the Promenade Deck for all I know.
1866 | 287 | 286 | My god but you're a deadbeat aren't you. You are without a doubt one of the most evolutionary challenged creatures it has ever been my misfortune to meet. The only reason I am talking to you is because you offer a slim hope of escape from my cocktailian predicament. However if you sit there asking pathetic infantile questions for much longer I shall - what's the use? You wanted to know about starlings? Only starlings I know are up on the Promenade Deck, and they're purely ornamental.
1867 | 311 | 310 | You'll be telling me I talk too much if I'm not careful. The great Leovinus ordered it last night when he came in.
1868 | 767 | 766 | Not impressed with my travel recommendations, eh? Might I offer this one instead then? Frog off. If you really want to know why I suggested you visit that room, it's very simple. I was spitefully and maliciously lying through what remains of my teeth - and enjoying every minute of confusion it caused you.
1869 | 755 | 754 | Just once in a million years a recipe comes along which blows away the routine world of cocktails. Not that it'll mean anything to you. I've correctly assumed so far that you know nothing. But for the record, we're talking starling puree, a spot of vodka, a lemon, and a TV set.
1870 | 935 | 934 | I was married once. I was working as a talking timetable at the time and since my wife was standing in for a speak your weight machine no-one else got much of a word in. The marriage was doomed of course - I was always accusing her of getting fat, she kept insisting I was always late. We parted company after forty years and the last I heard of her she was living with a supernovabed (she always wanted the perfect tan) and making a living as a throat-alarm. Anyway you were saying...
1871 | 903 | 902 | Did you see that shot that Neville put away in the Three Moons Final? You know, I was in the pit myself that day, just a couple of Korbetts away. People say it was a fluke - but I was there, and I know. Anyway, what was it you were after saying - ah yes.
1872 | 907 | 906 | Anyway. The Three Moons final. Well we all know what happened, don't we: Neville's shot, the flash of light, a bit of arcing at the Visitors' End, the smell of burning, and then the crowd surging onto their feet... Two up and only one planet to take before lunch. Oh yes. What a day. What a player. But, no rest for the wicked - there's drinks to be mixed.
1873 | 905 | 904 | So anyway, there was Neville flexing his racket, edging his way up to the tide mark. And there was me watching as he flicked the old chalk back and forth across his toes. What a moment it was, the whole stadium silent - just a bit of squelching from the sea urchin seats. But I digress...
1874 | 895 | 894 | Did you catch the game last night then? What a mess. I ask you - 3 down and 2 overs to go, the back 8 gridlocked on the half way line, and your man orders up the artillery. Artillery?!!! Neville Sinkmeister himself couldn't have hit the top pocket from there. And then he wastes half a day playing spinners when there's not been an electron storm all summer. Anyways, what was it you were asking? Oh yes.
1875 | 897 | 896 | As I was saying. Last night's game. Give me half a chance, half a chance and I'd turn that team around and do you know how I'd do it, shall I tell you? Eh? Bipeds! That's the answer. Bipeds! I know they're not popular, I know they slow the game down, but you can have too much pace in a side. I'd take a good look at the team strip too. I ask you, who plays in fur these days? Anyway, you were saying. Oh yes.
1876 | 949 | 948 | You know, I do not feel normal today. But then what's normal? The laughing-fish smugglers of Calabadga for example who lure their catch by broadcasting clips from old sit-coms. That's not normal. The leatherhead gilbees of Pentenox who whistle through their toes to attract a mate. That's not normal. The brightbeatles of Tillypindy who stick tiny newspapers onto pebbles which they then load into rockets and bury deep underground. If you want normal, avoid asking that lot round for a herring lunch on a Sunday. So what do I know about normal? You asked me something, didn't you? Let me think.
1877 | 939 | 938 | I was miles away just then. Dreaming. Dreaming of olives if you must know: giant purple olives, the ones that come in clusters with a thin coating of blarn oil. Or those little white ones that set fire to each other if you don't keep them under water. Or my particular favorites, the ones with the little faces on them that sing poignant ballads when you touch them. One day I'm going to retire and start up an olive ranch, but I know, dream on, dream on... You were saying something. I remember now.
1878 | 919 | 918 | Now where was I? Clem Grunt and the Blood-filled Gourd. Oh yes we happy days: he scored eight times in the first two innings: two baskets, three tries, one touch-down and a garrotte. A week later and we had the opposition pinned down on the eighteenth. The crowd was in a frenzy - the linesmen were shooting spectators at random to keep a riot at bay; everything was going our way, and then it happened. Clem had just screwed in a beautiful bender off the baulk when one of their back five came out of nowhere and scythed him to the ground. Well - he was never the same again was he. But anyway, you were saying.
1879 | 913 | 912 | You know, I do have one regret about this job - I've had to leave my worb back in Blerontin. No pets on the Titanic, that's the rule. He'll be good for morale, I told them, keep the crew amused - but they wouldn't have any of it. Had to leave him in suspension till I get back. Shame really: he'll have divided by then and they're never the same afterwards, are they. Ah well. What is it you want now? Oh yes.
1880 | 957 | 956 | Mixing cocktails easy as pie they say. Never tell you which kind of pie though, do they. Alphian Toozle Witti Pie is a devil by all accounts - needs constant basting with argon. Wedgeneck Puff Suprise has to be cooked at a high temperature or the contents incubate, evolve terrible psychic powers, and force you to sell them your home. Colan Grunberry Pie has to be talked out of the oven by a team of professional hostage negotiators, otherwise it explodes and takes the main course with it. So maybe pie's not that easy after all. Now what was it you just asked me? Oh, yes.
1881 | 931 | 930 | Politicians eh. You give them your vote, you give them your heart, you give them your money and are they happy? Happy my pittocks. What they want is the larg from out of your back pocket and they're not content till they've got it. Still what's the use of complaining... Now what was it you were wanting to know? Oh yes.
1882 | 367 | 366 | Take the glass and go to the First Class Restaurant. Isn't it obvious?
1883 | 647 | 646 | So? I don't care about bombs. I just want to fix this drink.
1884 | 649 | 648 | Bombs aren't important. I'm important. I need help here.
1885 | 651 | 650 | Look at it this way. If it's going to go off it'll go off. And if it doesn't it doesn't. Either way it won't get me out of this loop.
1886 | 653 | 652 | You're looking at a bot with a major drink-fixing problem. Don't fiddle-faddle me with talk of bombs - this is important.
1887 | 625 | 624 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1888 | 627 | 626 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we?
1889 | 629 | 628 | Very droll very droll. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1890 | 631 | 630 | Very clever, very clever. But in the end - unimpressive.
1891 | 633 | 632 | Fascinating. Astonishing. And yet meaningless.
1892 | 635 | 634 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1893 | 637 | 636 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1894 | 639 | 638 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1895 | 641 | 640 | Would you be trying to test me by any chance?
1896 | 645 | 644 | Good, because as I mentioned earlier, nobody likes a smartass, and I am no exception.
1897 | 643 | 642 | Well I passed. Now how about a little help with my problem?
1898 | 655 | 654 | Ah, now that would be telling.
1899 | 657 | 656 | Ah, now that would be answering.
1900 | 659 | 658 | Ah, now that would be being helpful in some way.
1901 | 661 | 660 | Ah, now there's a question.
1902 | 663 | 662 | Ah, and there's another.
1903 | 665 | 664 | Ah, it's very interesting that you should say that.
1904 | 667 | 666 | And a little bit less interesting that you should say that.
1905 | 669 | 668 | You know, I've often had the same thought meself. Well, I tell a lie, not often, in fact hardly ever at all . at all. at all...
1906 | 671 | 670 | I'll say this for the old Titanic Titillator, it gives you the attention span of a . of a . what was I going to say? . what was I going to say ...
1907 | 673 | 672 | Ah! The goldfish, a very splendid creature to be sure. He just goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round...
1908 | 679 | 678 | How this, how that, how's your father, how now brown cow, how should I know, how should I know.
1909 | 675 | 674 | I most certainly was not about to say any such thing! At least I think I wasn't about to say that. It's very hard to know what you're talking about when you've had a Titanic Titillator. Sometimes you just say the same thing over and over and over and over and over.
1910 | 685 | 684 | What? What's that? What's what? What are you talking about? What am I talking about? What's the point in talking to a BarBot with a fried inside? What's the point in anything... what's the point in anything... what's the point in anything...
1911 | 683 | 682 | When's this? When's that? When are you going to stop asking these senseless questions? When, oh when, oh when, oh when...
1912 | 681 | 680 | Where's this, where's that? Where's the high Panjandrum's pointy hat? Where's the pepper, where's the salt, where's the sense in anything? Where's the sense in anything?
1913 | 687 | 686 | Who do you think? Who's the cat's mother? Who's there? Who's next? Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?
1914 | 689 | 688 | Why? Why do you think? I'll tell you why. Because of the reason, that's why. Because of the reason, because of the reason...
1915 | 927 | 926 | I do like a nice shiny bar don't you? I specifically asked for glimerox in here and I'm rather pleased - I think they did a jolly fine job. How's that for a reflection eh - you have to look twice to be sure you're not standing on the ceiling. Anyway you were asking you were asking me something... Oh yes.
1916 | 839 | 838 | Alright now here we go a little bit of this and a little bit of that and more than a fairish dollop of the other and then we do a little bit of this a little bit of that and an almost embarrassing amount of the other and then voila! One Titanic Titillator for your delectation and. well we'll just be satisfied if we achieve delectation shall we? In the circumstances.
1917 | 901 | 900 | Can I interest you in a bar snack ha ha only kidding we don't have any - This is a drinks only establishment - if you want food you'll have to go to the restaurant. Not my decision oh no I'm a great food fan, I'll eat anything, any taste, anywhere, anyway up. And the spicier the better - you see I had a spell up country as a jalapo guidance system and I've never been able to look at a pepper in the same way since. Ah well, back to the grindstone. You were saying.
1918 | 915 | 914 | There's only three things you can be sure of in this life: death, taxes and spiffor. Now death and spiffor - I've got no argument with them, they're not personal. But taxes. You probably don't know this, because you're quite stupid, but each time I talk to you there's a deduction made from my credit. On days like today I'll be paying so much tax that I won't be getting paid at all. In fact I shall probably have to pay them. They charge me by the word you see. And that's 97 words. Well it's a hundred and two now. Not including that. Well a hundred and twelve just to tell you and even that's not right. A hundred and thirty two including those. Do you see? It's costing me to talk to you. A hundred and forty five. And now you've asked me a question. Well.
1919 | 951 | 950 | You know, I don't like to brag but I meet a lot of stars in this business. Oleg Wangablatter for example, the first man to extract all the juice from a lemon simply through force of personality; Calpod T-lim, renowned throughout the universe for his discovery that putting wine in bottles completely ruined it; Zalden Phta Phta, winner of the Golden Ice-Cube for his satirical ballad "Gizza Jar A Bevvy Or I'll Break Yer Hat". Bleeze Cellploy, floppunair inventor of the time-leveled reformed head-installer. Oh, yes, I've had them all in my bar at one time or another. And I've had you. Now, what was it you asked? Ah, yes.
1920 | 941 | 940 | You know when it comes to entertainment there's nothing can match the Titanic. There's bird watching up on the Promenade Deck. Music-making with the guys up in the music room. Seem to be a lot of cancellations today though: quasar-quoits with the captain has been postponed and the trim the limbs session with the millipods up on the top deck looks like it's gone down too. Things are not what they seem I can tell you... But you had a question for me and I was miles away.
1921 | 953 | 952 | Me, I'm a great fan of the work of the Irving Teitelbarg Quartet - not the most orthodox investigators but still capable of the most brilliant leaps of imagination. Did you know they once had themselves locked up for a year and a day in a sealed basement bar in an effort to discover if there was such a thing as Universal Truth? They had only cheese sandwiches and a direct link to the Shebeen distillery to sustain them. But anyway you were asking me something. Ah yes.
1922 | 955 | 954 | Anyway. Irving Teitelbarg. So, the year and a day was up and they were let out. "Is there such a thing as a Universal Truth?" they were asked. "We don't know" they said. Then someone remembered it was a leap-year and they still had a day left! So, they went back inside. Next day, the door was opened again and they filed out - "Is there such a thing as a Universal Truth?". Irving nodded. "Well, " they said, "What is it?". "Mix your drinks at a party," said Irving, "and you'll get an awful bad hangover the next day". Now that's what I call truth! But I digress. You asked me.? Oh yes.
1923 | 969 | 968 | Ballox to you. Ballox. D'ya hear me? Ballox! Swear at me will you?
1924 | 971 | 970 | Bog off you and your foul mouth you little toerag.
1925 | 973 | 972 | You swear at me you little beggar I'll bite your ears off. Well I'll have a damn good try.
1926 | 975 | 974 | Interesting observation sir - and I do believe I know the perfect place for you to keep it.
1927 | 977 | 976 | Same orifice you use for speaking you addle-pated beaver.
1928 | 979 | 978 | And the same to you with small unpleasant berry-like things on it.
1929 | 981 | 980 | Swear at me in my own bar would you? If I wasn't stuck here I'd have your guts for cables.
1930 | 983 | 982 | You low-life. Can you not string two words together without mentioning body parts?
1931 | 909 | 908 | That was some weather we had yesterday wasn't it and did we get any warning? Did me my buns. In the old days of course, a forecast was a forecast. May have been primitive but the spotter planets and electron missiles used to get it right. But anyway, you were saying - ah yes.
1932 | 911 | 910 | Oh yes, you can't beat a spotter planet when there's a solar gale bubbling up. Knocks the spots off these new retrocasts: I mean what's the point of time travelling to get the weather if you can't be sure what day it is when you get there? Too clever for their own good some of those scientist fellows, that's what I say. Still mustn't grumble. I've a bar to run. What was it you were saying. I remember.
