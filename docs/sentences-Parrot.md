159 | 111 | 110 | Give us a kiss! Give us a kiss! More to the more bloody point, give us a chicken! Give us a chicken! Give us a bleedin' pistachio nut!
160 | 137 | 136 | No point in talking to that! It'll only gob at you! All it's interested in doing is sucking or blowing! Try talking to it about Byzantine Numismatics and see what you get!
161 | 105 | 104 | No point talking to me, buster, I don't do smalltalk. Got more important things on my mind. Parrot things. Stuff you wouldn't know about. Not fit for human contemplation, hur whur. Squawk!
162 | 107 | 106 | No chitter chatter please, I'm a parrot! Give us a nut! Give us a nut! Give us a bleedin' pistachio!
163 | 109 | 108 | What did you say? What did you say? You come here and say that. No, better still, go away and say that. I don't want to hear any opinion of yours that isn't accompanied by good solid chunks of steaming chicken!
164 | 53 | 52 | You've been talking to that BarBot, haven't you! He's out of his skull half the time, and the other half of the time he's also out of his skull! Ha ha! Parrot humor! Us parrots have got a real way with with words, haven't we? Squawk Waaark!

168 | 61 | 60 | Waaark! You've been talking to that BellBot again haven't you? The light's on but there's nobody home!
169 | 43 | 42 | Wraaak! You've been talking to that DeskBot haven't you? You don't want to talk to that DeskBot! And if you do you certainly don't want to listen to what she says back!
170 | 45 | 44 | Wraaark! You've been talking to that DeskBot haven't you? I wouldn't do that! I'd rather talk to a duck than a DeskBot!
171 | 47 | 46 | You've been talking to that DeskBot haven't you? I wouldn't do that! I'd rather talk to a mallard than a DeskBot!
172 | 49 | 48 | You've been talking to that DeskBot haven't you? Well don't!
173 | 51 | 50 | You've been talking to that DeskBot haven't you? I wouldn't do that! I'd rather talk to a piping plover than a DeskBot!

And... and... oooh, well I can't think of anything else now, but it's a good metaphor isn't it? Good metaphor! Oooh sometimes I'm so proud to be a parrot I could pop!
175 | 65 | 64 | Arrrk! You've been talking to that DoorBot haven't! Mr. Snooty he is! Snooty but stupid! Snooty and stupid! And quite tall! Arrrk No! You don't want to listen to him!
176 | 67 | 66 | You've been talking to that DoorBot again, haven't you? Well don't!
177 | 1 | 0 | With my beak? That makes two of us out of our respective trees! It was that lying barman that set you up, wasn't it! Squawk!
178 | 3 | 2 | Wraar ar. Don't interrupt me, I'm having a think. And don't ask me what I'm thinking because I don't know, you keep interrupting me.
179 | 5 | 4 | Why don't you go and interrupt a Spotted Sandpiper.
180 | 7 | 6 | Why don't you go and interrupt a Herring Gull.
181 | 9 | 8 | Why don't you go and interrupt a Nuthatch.
182 | 11 | 10 | Why don't you go and interrupt a Snowy Egret!
183 | 13 | 12 | Leave me alone! Wreerk!
184 | 15 | 14 | Shut up! Shut up! I vant to be alone...
185 | 75 | 74 | Where's my perch! Where's my perch! I will not work without a perch! Wraaark!

187 | 69 | 68 | Arrrk! You've been talking to that Succ-U-Bus haven't you? I can tell by the layers of spit all over you! It's all just lies and phlegm!
188 | 71 | 70 | Waaark! You've been talking to that Succ-U-Bus haven't you? Don't listen to anything he tells you! And don't give him any chickens!
189 | 73 | 72 | Brarrk! You've been talking to that Succ-U-Bus again haven't you? Well don't!
190 | 395 | 394 | See if there's a 'free drinks for parrots' setting while you're about it!
191 | 393 | 392 | Fiddle around all you like, he's still just an airhead!
192 | 399 | 398 | See if there's a 'free chickens for parrots setting' while you're about it!
193 | 389 | 388 | Take more than a bit of fine adjustment to sort her out! She needs a complete head transplant!
194 | 391 | 390 | He'll still be just as snooty, you know, still be just as snooty!
195 | 401 | 400 | Won't do you any good! He's still just a superannuated old whinger!
196 | 397 | 396 | See if there's a 'free pistachio nuts for parrots' setting while you're about it!
197 | 387 | 386 | Squawk! If only it was that easy in real life! There's a lot of people whose settings I'd change, I can tell you!
198 | 385 | 384 | Hey, You! Sorry about your home! If you need somewhere to stay I've got a lovely cage going cheap! Or it would be going cheep if it was a chicken! Haha! Parrot humor! Don't you just love it!
199 | 363 | 362 | Don't mind if I do! Don't mind if I do! Pint of lager and a packet of crisps and I'll take it in my cage if it's all right with you.
200 | 335 | 334 | Puree a flock of starlings! What an insane thing to do! What are you going to do next?
201 | 419 | 418 | Squawk! Yikes! That bird didn't used to fly when it was alive!
202 | 421 | 420 | Squawk! Yikes! Fast food!
203 | 423 | 422 | Squawk! So many chickens! So little time!
204 | 365 | 364 | Shut up shut up shut up! There's enough noise around here with me squawking all the time without you joining in as well!
205 | 367 | 366 | Shut up shut up shut up! This is your parrot speaking! I said shut up!
206 | 369 | 368 | Shut up shut up shut up! Nobody's interested in your bleeding deck quoits and aerobic classes! What about some decent pistachio nuts eating classes! That would get the punters in! And the parrots! Squawk!
207 | 371 | 370 | Shut up! Who do you thinks listening! Nobody! At least, nobody that counts!
208 | 373 | 372 | Shut up! Who do you thinks listening! Nobody! At least, nobody that counts! No I don't mean the bomb! Not the stupid bomb! There's a big difference between counting and COUNTING, you know. I'm talking about who's hot and who's not! Not just a banal display of numerical literacy!
209 | 447 | 446 | What's all this counting for? What's that all about eh?
210 | 375 | 374 | Bloody gogglebox! Fifty-seven channels and nothing to watch! Never watch it! Rots the brain! No chickens!
211 | 377 | 376 | Turn that rubbish off! You'll get square eyes!
212 | 379 | 378 | Death to serial non-interactive entertainment forms! You're better off talking to a parrot! Not much, but a bit!
213 | 381 | 380 | Witless pabulum for the masses, that's all it is! Never shows a decent bit of chicken!
214 | 383 | 382 | Chicken. Oooh! Chicken! Oooh! There's a chicken channel! cooo! cooo! Nobody told me there was a chicken channel! My friends, this is the medium of the future! Wall to wall chickens! Digital chickens! Virtual chickens! Interactive chickens! But what about hot steaming chickens you can actually eat!
215 | 403 | 402 | Just because they're only a bunch of starlings doesn't mean you can go around pureeing them!
216 | 405 | 404 | You wouldn't do that to a wisp of snipe!
217 | 407 | 406 | You wouldn't do that to a charm of finches!
218 | 409 | 408 | You wouldn't do that to a covey of partridges!

223 | 81 | 80 | Bwarrk! What's going on here! Everyone's looking a bit pique today aren't they? Nice music though! I like something you can get a good squawk going to! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk! Squawk!
224 | 83 | 82 | Oh! What's going on here! Everyone's looking a bit pique today aren't they? Ooh I hate this kind of slushy music! Makes me want to spit!
225 | 145 | 144 | No point in talking to him! Nothing to think with! Just a bit of rotten rubber piping and a couple of logic gates! No conversation to speak of! Warh hah! No conversation to speak of! Ha wark! It's the way I tell 'em, it's the way I tell 'em!
226 | 321 | 320 | Arghh! The bells! The bells! Ha ha! Squawk!
227 | 323 | 322 | Arghh! The bells! The bells! ha! Squawk! Gets funnier every time don't it? Eh heh!
228 | 155 | 154 | Nothing you want to know about! It sucks things and it blows things. Don't even think about it! Things disappear! Things appear! Things are not where they ought to be all of a sudden! Very unhealthy! Don't go near it. I wouldn't!
229 | 157 | 156 | Warrk! I'm a parrot! What do you bleeding think I am? I'm a parrot. Anybody tells you I'm a macaw, spit at them! I'm a parrot!
