30 | 1589 | 1588 | Perhaps, dear guest, you should remember that you're not only 3rd class but you're also having a free ride.
31 | 1543 | 1542 | All the time.

38 | 1969 | 1968 | I do believe that's a glass.
39 | 1967 | 1966 | That is a television.
40 | 1965 | 1964 | That could well be the Vision Center.
41 | 2479 | 2478 | Dear Fortillian. Such a charming fellow. And quite capable of the most horrendous fibs when the mood takes him.
42 | 2457 | 2456 | No. Not really a traveler you see.
43 | 1699 | 1698 | My apologies for the BellBot. He was the best that could be found at short notice.
44 | 1701 | 1700 | Krage is not the most sophisticated member of the crew.
45 | 1703 | 1702 | So uncouth. My apologies.
46 | 1705 | 1704 | The boy has many arduous years of training ahead of him.

54 | 1653 | 1652 | Have an awfully pleasant day.
55 | 1655 | 1654 | Just call if I can be of further service.
56 | 1657 | 1656 | I look forward to our next meeting.
57 | 1659 | 1658 | Goodbye.
58 | 1661 | 1660 | I'm sorry, do I know you?
59 | 1663 | 1662 | Never heard of you.
60 | 1665 | 1664 | Being rather familiar aren't you?
61 | 1709 | 1708 | Extraordinary. I haven't a clue what you're talking about and I'm actually one of the brighter ones on this ship.
62 | 2079 | 2078 | That's the Cellpoint for the BarBot.
63 | 2073 | 2072 | That's the Cellpoint for the BellBot.
64 | 2075 | 2074 | That's the Cellpoint for the DeskBot.
65 | 2077 | 2076 | That's my Cellpoint. If you're going to tamper with it I'd be grateful if you took a little care.
66 | 2081 | 2080 | That's the Cellpoint for the LiftBot.
67 | 1991 | 1990 | That's a statue of Brobostigon.
68 | 1989 | 1988 | That's a statue of Leovinus.
69 | 1993 | 1992 | That's a statue of Scraliontis.
70 | 2471 | 2470 | The crew of the Starship Titanic are beyond reproach.
71 | 2177 | 2176 | Fentible.
72 | 2195 | 2194 | Yes.
73 | 2375 | 2374 | Typical.
74 | 2377 | 2376 | It's never too late.
75 | 2379 | 2378 | I'm not a taxi.
76 | 2381 | 2380 | Many times.
77 | 2383 | 2382 | Not much recently.
78 | 2385 | 2384 | Aah, just like the good old days.
79 | 2387 | 2386 | Not much.
80 | 2197 | 2196 | No.
81 | 2199 | 2198 | Well, maybe.
82 | 2201 | 2200 | Why?
83 | 2203 | 2202 | What for?
84 | 2205 | 2204 | Yes, I do too.
85 | 2207 | 2206 | Do you?
86 | 2209 | 2208 | That's good.
87 | 2211 | 2210 | Never heard of him.
88 | 2213 | 2212 | Never heard of her.
89 | 2179 | 2178 | I do.
90 | 2215 | 2214 | Never heard of them.
91 | 2217 | 2216 | What's one of those.
92 | 2219 | 2218 | You're awfully chatty.
93 | 2221 | 2220 | That's right.
94 | 2223 | 2222 | Me too.
95 | 2225 | 2224 | All the time.
96 | 2227 | 2226 | Whatever you say.
97 | 2229 | 2228 | I'm not sure.
98 | 2231 | 2230 | Do what?
99 | 2233 | 2232 | Not today thank you.
100 | 2181 | 2180 | I would.
101 | 2235 | 2234 | Gosh.
102 | 2237 | 2236 | I've no idea.
103 | 2239 | 2238 | It is.
104 | 2241 | 2240 | They do.
105 | 2243 | 2242 | They are.
106 | 2245 | 2244 | Could be.
107 | 2247 | 2246 | Certainly is.
108 | 2249 | 2248 | What's the point in that?
109 | 2251 | 2250 | Oh, I see.
110 | 2253 | 2252 | Oh, I don't know.
111 | 2183 | 2182 | I wouldn't.
112 | 2255 | 2254 | Oh I love it.
113 | 2257 | 2256 | I'm really not sure about that.
114 | 2259 | 2258 | I never was a great fan.
115 | 2261 | 2260 | They have.
116 | 2263 | 2262 | A little.
117 | 2265 | 2264 | I know.
118 | 2267 | 2266 | I should think not.
119 | 2269 | 2268 | Many times.
120 | 2271 | 2270 | Never again.
121 | 2273 | 2272 | I might.
122 | 2185 | 2184 | Really?
123 | 2275 | 2274 | It might.
124 | 2277 | 2276 | No can do old boy.
125 | 2279 | 2278 | Well, I'm not.
126 | 2281 | 2280 | That's good.
127 | 2283 | 2282 | Call it a hunch.
128 | 2285 | 2284 | I'm not.
129 | 2287 | 2286 | I am.
130 | 2289 | 2288 | You're not.
131 | 2291 | 2290 | You are.
132 | 2293 | 2292 | You will.
133 | 2187 | 2186 | Would you?
134 | 2295 | 2294 | Oh.
135 | 2297 | 2296 | Oh dear.
136 | 2299 | 2298 | Me too.
137 | 2301 | 2300 | Please?
138 | 2303 | 2302 | Yes, you're right.
139 | 2305 | 2304 | Isn't she?
140 | 2307 | 2306 | Isn't he?
141 | 2309 | 2308 | Aren't they?
142 | 2311 | 2310 | Won't they?
143 | 2313 | 2312 | Won't she?
144 | 2189 | 2188 | Do you?
145 | 2315 | 2314 | Won't he?
146 | 2317 | 2316 | Does he?
147 | 2319 | 2318 | Does she?
148 | 2321 | 2320 | Do they?
149 | 2323 | 2322 | Go on.
150 | 2325 | 2324 | Is that so?
151 | 2327 | 2326 | Is that right?
152 | 2329 | 2328 | My goodness.
153 | 2331 | 2330 | Oh oh.
154 | 2333 | 2332 | I see.
155 | 2191 | 2190 | Will you?
156 | 2335 | 2334 | No problem at all.
157 | 2337 | 2336 | That's right.
158 | 2339 | 2338 | Of course.
159 | 2341 | 2340 | Could be.
160 | 2343 | 2342 | Who?
161 | 2345 | 2344 | What?
162 | 2347 | 2346 | Where?
163 | 2349 | 2348 | Why?
164 | 2351 | 2350 | When?
165 | 2353 | 2352 | Is he?
166 | 2193 | 2192 | Are you sure?
167 | 2355 | 2354 | Is she?
168 | 2357 | 2356 | Are they?
169 | 2359 | 2358 | Will he?
170 | 2361 | 2360 | Will she?
171 | 2363 | 2362 | Will they?
172 | 2365 | 2364 | Did he?
173 | 2367 | 2366 | Did she?
174 | 2369 | 2368 | Did they?
175 | 2371 | 2370 | Just like you.
176 | 2373 | 2372 | Just like me.
177 | 2159 | 2158 | That's the day after.
178 | 2173 | 2172 | Flatterday.
179 | 2161 | 2160 | Hammerday.
180 | 2167 | 2166 | Harday.
181 | 2157 | 2156 | Today is:
182 | 2171 | 2170 | Otherday.
183 | 2163 | 2162 | Rowday.
184 | 2169 | 2168 | Spryday.
185 | 2175 | 2174 | Umph.
186 | 2165 | 2164 | Welday.
187 | 2421 | 2420 | Just change her settings old chap.
188 | 2465 | 2464 | No. Funny old world eh.
189 | 2425 | 2424 | Each to his own.
190 | 2401 | 2400 | Well I don't either.
191 | 1997 | 1996 | That I do believe is one of Titania's Eyes.
192 | 1999 | 1998 | That's Nobby. He's a LiftBot.
193 | 2011 | 2010 | That's the bell to summon the DeskBot.
194 | 2005 | 2004 | That's Marsinta. The DeskBot.
195 | 2003 | 2002 | That's your Personal Electronic Thing.
196 | 2009 | 2008 | That's the special Plinth.
197 | 2007 | 2006 | That's a Succ-U-Bus.
198 | 2447 | 2446 | Just buy the essentials these days.
199 | 2449 | 2448 | Tea's the only thing I drink.
200 | 2451 | 2450 | No. Like to be in control you see.
201 | 2433 | 2432 | No but I did once have a rather nice pen.
202 | 2431 | 2430 | Good god no, I'm far too cowardly.
203 | 2445 | 2444 | Don't read much these days. Eyes are going you see.
204 | 2475 | 2474 | What is that, some kind of transport?
205 | 2461 | 2460 | No. Never felt the need.
206 | 2463 | 2462 | Only for constipation old fellow.
207 | 2459 | 2458 | Good lord no. Stick to what you know Fentible, that's what I say.
208 | 2429 | 2428 | Don't believe in 'em.
209 | 2391 | 2390 | Sadly that's a word I just don't use any more.
210 | 2469 | 2468 | Not interested old fellow. Don't watch films.
211 | 1569 | 1568 | That's an excellent plan, with only one flaw that I can see.
212 | 1571 | 1570 | Who said anything about a flaw?
213 | 1631 | 1630 | Did you ask something? Did I ask something? Did something ask you?
214 | 1649 | 1648 | Aim for the second moon Wrottifer - we're going to fly this barge-buster right down their throats.
215 | 1633 | 1632 | Mmm? Oh, pardon me, what was that you said?
216 | 1635 | 1634 | Edwina you need a shave.
217 | 1637 | 1636 | Sorry, were you talking to me? I've lost something but I can't for the life of me remember what it was.
218 | 1639 | 1638 | Have we met? I'm getting a strange sense of deja vu, voodoo blues, hoola hoops. Up and down the teapot mine's the one with the hat.
219 | 1641 | 1640 | Where's my wheelbarrow?
220 | 1643 | 1642 | My comrade needs a new set of leg puttees.
221 | 1645 | 1644 | Will you buy my hen?
222 | 1647 | 1646 | Careful with that laser doctor.
223 | 1781 | 1780 | I'm sorry but I just don't understand why you want to bring that up now.
224 | 1783 | 1782 | To be honest I can't quite see the relevance of that at the moment.
225 | 1785 | 1784 | If I had the remotest interest in that I'd answer you, but I haven't so I won't.
226 | 1787 | 1786 | That's an interesting point but this is not the time to raise it.
227 | 1789 | 1788 | You're probably right but just now there are more important things to be getting on with.
228 | 1791 | 1790 | That's all well and good but you ought really to be making better use of your time on board.
229 | 1793 | 1792 | Without wishing to appear rude, I do believe there are other things you could be thinking about.
230 | 1795 | 1794 | Forgive me for suggesting this, but I do think your thoughts could be better invested elsewhere.
231 | 1797 | 1796 | Jolly interesting and all that but don't you think there are more pressing matters to deal with?
232 | 1799 | 1798 | Well, a visit to the First Class Restaurant might be worthwhile.
233 | 1801 | 1800 | Perhaps you should explore some of the First Class Staterooms.
234 | 1803 | 1802 | Perhaps you ought to have a good look around your Second Class Stateroom.
235 | 1805 | 1804 | Why don't you visit the Arboretum?
236 | 1807 | 1806 | Have you thought about going up to the Bar?
237 | 1809 | 1808 | Perhaps you ought to have a look at the Bilge Room?
238 | 1811 | 1810 | Perhaps you ought to have another look at the Bilge Room?
239 | 1813 | 1812 | Have you visited the Bottom of the Well yet?
240 | 1815 | 1814 | Perhaps, if you haven't done so already, you ought to visit the Creators Chamber.
241 | 1817 | 1816 | A trip up and down in the elevator would help you get your bearings all right.
242 | 1819 | 1818 | Perhaps you ought to visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a good talk with the DeskBot?
243 | 1821 | 1820 | A trip down the Grand Canal might prove fruitful.
244 | 1823 | 1822 | Perhaps you should go up to the Music Room and listen to Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers.
245 | 1825 | 1824 | I'm pretty sure there's more than meets the eye going on in the Parrot Lobby.
246 | 1827 | 1826 | Well, a good stroll around the Promenade Deck might do wonders for you right now.
247 | 1829 | 1828 | None of my business of course but I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue.
248 | 1831 | 1830 | Why not spend a little time exploring your SGT Bedroom - I'm sure it will be worthwhile.
249 | 1833 | 1832 | If you haven't had a proper look at the SGT Lounge well now's the time.
250 | 1835 | 1834 | Well, I think now might be a good time to explore the SGT Restaurant.
251 | 1837 | 1836 | Well, you still haven't visited Titania's Room and I do think that's one of the highlights of the ship.
252 | 1839 | 1838 | Perhaps you ought to have a good look around the Top of the Well.
253 | 1551 | 1550 | Hardly ever.
254 | 2413 | 2412 | No, they're far too messy.
255 | 2415 | 2414 | I do have a pet hate - parrots.
256 | 2417 | 2416 | They lack manners.
257 | 2403 | 2402 | No I don't believe I have.
258 | 2389 | 2388 | No I haven't I'm afraid.
259 | 1415 | 1414 | Might I recommend a visit to the Arboretum - I do believe one can change the weather up there.
260 | 1451 | 1450 | There's a rumor going round that there's a body stuck in the Bilge Room pipes.
261 | 1449 | 1448 | Heaven knows what foul and dark deeds have led to our present predicament. Krage tells me he's seen a body in the First Class Restaurant.
262 | 1433 | 1432 | Just pop down to the old Sculpture Chamber and pull a few levers. Easy as chucking a TV down the Well.
263 | 1457 | 1456 | You've got to be rather clever to defuse a bomb like that you know.
264 | 1417 | 1416 | If it's a crushed television set you're after, might I suggest a chat with the BellBot?
265 | 1455 | 1454 | Might I suggest you defuse the bomb before it goes off?
266 | 1427 | 1426 | Krage was telling me that the best way to crush a TV was to drop it from the top of the Well.
267 | 1459 | 1458 | I know exactly what you mean. The answer's on the tip of my whatjamacallit... no, it's no use. Try asking Krage - he'll remember.
268 | 1443 | 1442 | Perhaps you should be applying your undoubted mental skills to the problem of why the cyberintelligence is out of control.
269 | 1441 | 1440 | In the drawer by your bed I believe.
270 | 1421 | 1420 | Now where have I seen lemons? Perhaps you should take a little stroll up to the Arboretum.
271 | 1423 | 1422 | I do believe they have lemons up in the Arboretum.
272 | 1447 | 1446 | You ought to have a look at the TV channels you know. There's something decidedly odd going on in one of the First Class Staterooms.
273 | 1437 | 1436 | If I were you I'd pay a visit to the Music Room.
274 | 1435 | 1434 | Of course, if you're not satisfied with me, you're quite at liberty to go down to the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings.
275 | 1439 | 1438 | If you don't like the SGT room might I suggest a glance at the in-flight magazine - it always has plenty of ideas on getting upgraded.
276 | 1453 | 1452 | Search the bodies. It's a nasty job but somebody always does it.
277 | 1419 | 1418 | Do you know I do believe they have starlings up on the Promenade Deck. Perhaps you could throw a little puree together up there.
278 | 1445 | 1444 | If I were you I'd have a good look round Titania's Chamber - that's where all the controls are.
279 | 1425 | 1424 | I think you ought to pop up to the bar and give Fortillian a hand with his Titanic Titillator.
280 | 1431 | 1430 | Secret of getting an upgrade, you know, is to get on the right side of Marsinta. Only way to do that is to change her settings.
281 | 1429 | 1428 | You know there's a rather starlingy smell down in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant. Perhaps that's where the puree's gone?
282 | 2455 | 2454 | No. Just work work work for me.
283 | 2027 | 2026 | Those are your CD's.
284 | 2025 | 2024 | I expect that's your computer.
285 | 2023 | 2022 | That's a rather useful photograph of the night sky.
286 | 2029 | 2028 | That's a television if I'm not mistaken.
287 | 2121 | 2120 | Was I rambling again?
288 | 2123 | 2122 | You just interrupt whenever you like.
289 | 2125 | 2124 | I was probably talking nonsense anyway.
290 | 2127 | 2126 | Do you have to interrupt so much?
291 | 2129 | 2128 | All this interrupting, I keep losing my place.
292 | 2131 | 2130 | Oh dear you've had to interrupt me. I am losing it.
293 | 2133 | 2132 | Oh dear you've interrupted me. That's a bad sign.
294 | 2443 | 2442 | Good lord no.
295 | 2435 | 2434 | What's a lightbulb?
296 | 2437 | 2436 | Well how do you expect me to know?
297 | 2467 | 2466 | Never seen any.
298 | 2411 | 2410 | No, but I don't listen to much music anyway.
299 | 1523 | 1522 | Maybe.
300 | 1525 | 1524 | Possibly. But I can't really remember for sure.
301 | 1527 | 1526 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
302 | 1529 | 1528 | I used to think yes. And then I thought no. Now I'm just not sure.
303 | 1531 | 1530 | Lovely question. Beautiful phrasing. Did you want an answer?
304 | 1535 | 1534 | Well why did you ask?
305 | 1533 | 1532 | Well you've come to the wrong place. I can't remember a thing.
306 | 1537 | 1536 | I'm not going to dignify that with a reply - but only because I can't remember one.
307 | 1539 | 1538 | Without a doubt. Well, perhaps just a small doubt. Actually, it's quite a niggling one now.
308 | 1561 | 1560 | That might be the right thing to do and then again it might not.
309 | 2439 | 2438 | I belong to nobody. I am a free spirit.
310 | 1615 | 1614 | Aaaaagh! Memory failure! Memory failure!
311 | 1617 | 1616 | Aaaaagh! Damn memory's fading again. Bear with me.
312 | 1619 | 1618 | Anything... you can do... to help would be... appreciated. Memory slippage alert. Memory slippage alert?
313 | 1621 | 1620 | Damn this memory board. Don't expect much sense out of me for a bit. Much Out sEnSE me Bit sense.
314 | 1623 | 1622 | Memory's going. Doesn't last too long. Should be OK soon, should be OK soon, should be OK soon...
315 | 1625 | 1624 | Would somebody please explain to me why my memory keeps failing??
316 | 1627 | 1626 | I... Fentible... Memory going... who?? what?? Coming back soon, coming back soon, just off to the shops, coming back soon, lie down, in your basket, coming back soon...
317 | 1629 | 1628 | I... damn, I've lost it. Gone for good, gone for ever. I'll always remember Doreen. Doreen who? Shan't expect I'll ever find it again. What was it, anyway?
318 | 2039 | 2038 | I think that is the bass player.
319 | 2037 | 2036 | That's Boppy Headcase himself at the piano.
320 | 2045 | 2044 | They look like blank cylinders to me.
321 | 2047 | 2046 | That I suspect is one of Titania's Ears.
322 | 2033 | 2032 | Heaven knows what it's called - some kind of snake instrument.
323 | 2041 | 2040 | That's some kind of phonograph I believe.
324 | 2043 | 2042 | I do believe that's the box for the phonograph cylinders.
325 | 2035 | 2034 | I believe they are a form of tubular bells.
326 | 1541 | 1540 | Never.
327 | 1491 | 1490 | No.
328 | 1509 | 1508 | I don't think so.
329 | 1511 | 1510 | Not a hope.
330 | 1513 | 1512 | Absolutely out of the question.
331 | 1515 | 1514 | You've gone so far wrong you've nearly bumped into yourself on the way back.
332 | 1517 | 1516 | Wrong.
333 | 1519 | 1518 | If I might be so bold, that is a remarkably dumb question. No.
334 | 1521 | 1520 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
335 | 1493 | 1492 | No.
336 | 1495 | 1494 | No...
337 | 1497 | 1496 | No.
338 | 1499 | 1498 | No.
339 | 1501 | 1500 | No.
340 | 1503 | 1502 | No.
341 | 1505 | 1504 | Oh dear no.
342 | 1507 | 1506 | Never.
343 | 1573 | 1572 | No I didn't.
344 | 1575 | 1574 | Oh no I didn't.
345 | 1577 | 1576 | Didn't.
346 | 1579 | 1578 | Didn't.
347 | 1581 | 1580 | Didn't not too. Oh no I'm in a loop I'm in a loop Krage Krage help I'm in a loop.
348 | 1583 | 1582 | How can I help?
349 | 1585 | 1584 | Nothing happened.
350 | 1557 | 1556 | I can't remember that ever happening, but don't forget - I can't even remember my own name.
351 | 1567 | 1566 | Well you've got me there. Afraid I can't remember.
352 | 1547 | 1546 | Often.
353 | 2419 | 2418 | Only the parrot.
354 | 2051 | 2050 | I think that could be the Central Core.
355 | 2055 | 2054 | Those are parrot feathers.
356 | 2057 | 2056 | That's Titania's Nose I believe.
357 | 2053 | 2052 | That is the Parrot.
358 | 2059 | 2058 | That's a perch.
359 | 2061 | 2060 | That is a television.

374 | 1775 | 1774 | er.... oh, it's on the tip of my, ah... my, er... oh, you know... that thing. Er... what did you say again?

383 | 1779 | 1778 | That leads to Titania's Room.
384 | 1743 | 1742 | Well.
385 | 1727 | 1726 | That is a.
386 | 1723 | 1722 | That is the.
387 | 1725 | 1724 | This is a.
388 | 1721 | 1720 | This is the.
389 | 1729 | 1728 | Try looking in the.
390 | 2069 | 2068 | Those are the controls for the fans.
391 | 2067 | 2066 | That's a hammer dispenser.
392 | 2065 | 2064 | That looks like a flock of starlings to me.
393 | 2137 | 2136 | Al q'Hamra.
394 | 2143 | 2142 | Bristil.
395 | 2141 | 2140 | Genneth.
396 | 2151 | 2150 | Hwhifft.
397 | 2135 | 2134 | It is:
398 | 2153 | 2152 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
399 | 2155 | 2154 | Forty-two? I don't remember saying that.
400 | 2145 | 2144 | Splod.
401 | 2147 | 2146 | Tarbert.
402 | 2149 | 2148 | Voedio.
403 | 2139 | 2138 | Vortigan.
404 | 1711 | 1710 | You know, I have a theory about that.
405 | 1713 | 1712 | It's a conspiracy theory.
406 | 1719 | 1718 | Delightful spot for a vacation I hear.
407 | 1717 | 1716 | Dear old Nobby, knows how to spin a yarn doesn't he.
408 | 2489 | 2488 | The science of genteel service - that's the only science I know.
409 | 2491 | 2490 | Call me old fashioned, but I think science is best left to frogs.
410 | 2493 | 2492 | Did I say frogs? I meant to say scientists.
411 | 1715 | 1714 | You should ask the LiftBot about that - he's the expert.
412 | 1679 | 1678 | Didn't you say that just a moment ago?
413 | 1681 | 1680 | I do believe I heard that question the first time round.
414 | 1683 | 1682 | You know, repeating a question doesn't make it any more intelligent.
415 | 1685 | 1684 | At the risk of repeating myself...
416 | 1687 | 1686 | I thought I told you before...
417 | 1689 | 1688 | I believe the last time you asked me that, I said...
418 | 1691 | 1690 | Do you have a hearing difficulty? I said...
419 | 1693 | 1692 | I admire your persistence. Nevertheless, there are some questions which I am simply unable to answer.
420 | 1695 | 1694 | I see. You're thinking "fourth time lucky". Well, I'm afraid you won't be.
421 | 1697 | 1696 | I shall seek out Krage and ask his advice. He too suffers from the most debilitating loops.
422 | 1565 | 1564 | Whatever. I'm right behind you.
423 | 2083 | 2082 | That's the SCSI Cable. Heaven knows what it's for.
424 | 2395 | 2394 | No, I can't say I have.
425 | 2407 | 2406 | No, but I don't get out much you see.
426 | 2409 | 2408 | No but I wasn't particularly looking to be honest.
427 | 2099 | 2098 | That is a picture of Doreen McLevity.
428 | 2097 | 2096 | That's a long stick.
429 | 2103 | 2102 | I do believe that is a chicken.
430 | 2105 | 2104 | I think that is a chicken dispenser.
431 | 2089 | 2088 | That's the in-flight magazine.
432 | 2091 | 2090 | That's your television.
433 | 2393 | 2392 | I've not slept for years, period, old fellow.
434 | 1605 | 1604 | I do believe we're being cleverer than we'll ever know.
435 | 2441 | 2440 | No I'm not really the mixing type any more.
436 | 1545 | 1544 | Sometimes.
437 | 1549 | 1548 | Occasionally.
438 | 1673 | 1672 | Ah, spring. The best part of winter if you ask me.
439 | 2423 | 2422 | Have you tried changing his settings?
440 | 1675 | 1674 | Thank goodness for summer. Yes, cast aside those rotting pullovers and let the Ladies see the Whites as they used to say at the Club.
441 | 2397 | 2396 | No, I don't believe I have.
442 | 1553 | 1552 | That'll be the day.
443 | 2405 | 2404 | No.
444 | 1555 | 1554 | From time to time.
445 | 2113 | 2112 | That, I fear, is a Bomb.
446 | 2115 | 2114 | That is Titania.
447 | 2111 | 2110 | Those are televisions.
448 | 2119 | 2118 | Those are the buttons for the lifts.
449 | 2453 | 2452 | Never watch it.
450 | 1677 | 1676 | You can be sure someone will switch the weather before we've had a chance to enjoy it.
451 | 1853 | 1852 | I'm no expert but I'm inclined to the view that that's the Auditory Center.
452 | 1843 | 1842 | I do believe that's the Central Core.
453 | 1845 | 1844 | That is undoubtedly a chicken.
454 | 1847 | 1846 | I do believe it's a computer.
455 | 1891 | 1890 | Those are music cylinders for the phonograph.
456 | 1849 | 1848 | I do believe that's one of Titania's ears.
457 | 1851 | 1850 | I do believe that's Titania's other ear.
458 | 1855 | 1854 | That's one of Titania's eyes I suspect.
459 | 1857 | 1856 | That my dear friend is Titania's other eye.
460 | 1859 | 1858 | Mmm. Feathers. Parrot feathers I expect.
461 | 1863 | 1862 | It's a glass.
462 | 1865 | 1864 | A hammer I expect.
463 | 1867 | 1866 | That's a hose.
464 | 1877 | 1876 | Those are musical instruments.
465 | 1871 | 1870 | Looks rather like a LiftBot Head to me.
466 | 1873 | 1872 | That's a long stick without a doubt.
467 | 1869 | 1868 | That's your in-flight magazine.
468 | 1875 | 1874 | I do believe that's Titania's Mouth.
469 | 1879 | 1878 | That's a napkin.
470 | 1881 | 1880 | That looks like Titania's Nose.
471 | 1883 | 1882 | Some kind of notes I suspect.
472 | 1885 | 1884 | I think that's called the Olfactory Center.
473 | 1887 | 1886 | It's a perch - probably for the Parrot.
474 | 1841 | 1840 | That charming little device is your very own Personal Electronic Thing.
475 | 1889 | 1888 | That's the phonograph.
476 | 1893 | 1892 | It's a photograph.
477 | 1895 | 1894 | That's a giant SCSI cable.
478 | 1897 | 1896 | That, I believe is the Send Yourself Plug-in.
479 | 1899 | 1898 | That could be Titania's Speech Center.
480 | 1861 | 1860 | That's a flock of starlings.
481 | 1901 | 1900 | That's the Succ-U-Bus - the Titanic's delivery system.
482 | 1903 | 1902 | Those are sweets.
483 | 1905 | 1904 | That's a television.
484 | 1907 | 1906 | That looks like Titania's Visual Center.
485 | 1669 | 1668 | Elbow juice valves. Awful things freeze up in cold weather.
486 | 1913 | 1912 | It's a trans-galactic liner.
487 | 1911 | 1910 | It's called the Starship Titanic.
488 | 2473 | 2472 | We'll find out one day no doubt.
489 | 2013 | 2012 | This is the First Class Grand Axial Canal.
490 | 1915 | 1914 | This is the First Class Lobby.
491 | 1917 | 1916 | This is the First Class Restaurant.
492 | 1931 | 1930 | This is a First Class Stateroom.
493 | 2019 | 2018 | This is the Grand Axial Canal Second Class.
494 | 1939 | 1938 | This is the Second Class Lobby.
495 | 1941 | 1940 | This is a Second Class Stateroom.
496 | 1953 | 1952 | This is the Arboretum.
497 | 1961 | 1960 | This is the Bar.
498 | 1973 | 1972 | This is the Bilge Room.
499 | 1981 | 1980 | This is the bottom of the Well.
500 | 2107 | 2106 | This is a short corridor.
501 | 1987 | 1986 | This is called the Creators Chamber.
502 | 1995 | 1994 | That's the Elevator.
503 | 2001 | 2000 | This is the Embarkation Lobby.
504 | 2031 | 2030 | This is the Music Room and you're looking at Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers.
505 | 2049 | 2048 | This is the Parrot Room.
506 | 2063 | 2062 | This is the Promenade Deck.
507 | 2071 | 2070 | This is the Sculpture Chamber.
508 | 2085 | 2084 | That's the Service Elevator. You can't go back down there.
509 | 2093 | 2092 | This is the SGT Lobby.
510 | 2095 | 2094 | This is the SGT Lounge.
511 | 2101 | 2100 | This is the SGT Restaurant.
512 | 2087 | 2086 | This is your SGT Bedroom.
513 | 1909 | 1908 | We're on the Starship Titanic.
514 | 2109 | 2108 | That's Titania's Room.
515 | 2117 | 2116 | This is the Top of the Well.
516 | 1607 | 1606 | I shall summon him for you immediately.
517 | 2487 | 2486 | Do you know I've been asking myself that and I just don't know.
518 | 2485 | 2484 | From Blerontis.
519 | 2477 | 2476 | There's not a bar in the galaxy doesn't stock Signurian vodka. Civilization as we know it would crumble without the stuff.
520 | 2483 | 2482 | Can't remember. Sorry.
521 | 2481 | 2480 | They never tell us. All I know is I was assembled in Blerontis.
522 | 2021 | 2020 | This is your lovely home.
523 | 1609 | 1608 | Brobostigon is our esteemed and deeply floribund project manager.
524 | 1611 | 1610 | Leovinus is our inspired Creator, Architect, Master Engineer, Genius. The Man who built the Starship Titanic.
525 | 1613 | 1612 | Scraliontis? He's the Accountant.
526 | 1667 | 1666 | At least it's not winter. Plays havoc with my fettles you know, winter.
527 | 2427 | 2426 | Well you're entitled to your opinion.
528 | 1461 | 1460 | Yes.
529 | 1479 | 1478 | Indeed.
530 | 1481 | 1480 | I do believe it looks that way.
531 | 1483 | 1482 | Most certainly.
532 | 1485 | 1484 | If it makes you happy.
533 | 1487 | 1486 | Oh yes, and very amusing it is too.
534 | 1489 | 1488 | I can think of worse ways to while away your time...
535 | 1563 | 1562 | Absolutely.
536 | 1463 | 1462 | Yes.
537 | 1465 | 1464 | Yes?
538 | 1467 | 1466 | Yes.
539 | 1469 | 1468 | Yes.
540 | 1471 | 1470 | Yes.
541 | 1473 | 1472 | Yes.
542 | 1475 | 1474 | Help yourself.
543 | 1477 | 1476 | Correct.
544 | 2399 | 2398 | Don't have much opportunity you know these days.
545 | 1559 | 1558 | I do believe you're right, which makes a refreshing change.
546 | 2537 | 2536 | In any of our lavishly appointed Staterooms.
547 | 3955 | 3954 | The chap on the bells is a great expert of course. Nothing phases him.
548 | 2881 | 2880 | Absolutely top of the world.
549 | 2883 | 2882 | As well as can be expected.
550 | 2495 | 2494 | Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear. Oh dear oh dear oh dear oh dear.
551 | 2525 | 2524 | It's our maiden voyage, you see, but the ship has, well, it's lost its mind and so has most of its crew, including me, though I do have my lucid moments. I only wish I knew if this was one of them.
552 | 2527 | 2526 | Oh look, things are going from bad to worse. I can't even find the buttons now. Can you help me? Top button. Terribly sorry. It's my cellpoint settings you see. Well, I don't suppose you do see, but it is my cellpoint settings anyway.
553 | 2529 | 2528 | Come on, top button.
554 | 2531 | 2530 | No, no, the top button. There's no time to lose!
555 | 2533 | 2532 | Human being isn't it? Yes, well of course one's heard mixed reports. I just hope that you can sort out these problems, because none of us can. We're all robots you see and what's happened is that the ship's central intelligence has been lobotomized, sabotaged if you ask me, and it's left us all unable to function properly and you may find that we are all a little doolally, I know that I am, so it's all going to be up to you. As soon as we reach the Embarkation Lobby press the button on the plinth and we'll be on our way. Then go and see Marsinta, she's the DeskBot and a bit of a dragon when her settings are wrong. She'll check you in. All I've managed to secure for you is a Super Galactic Traveler class room, but I'm sure you'll manage. You can always ask Marsinta for an upgrade, but be ready to duck. You'll meet Krage the BellBot who should take you to your room if he's functioning properly, then once you've settled in and made yourself comfortable you'll be able to get on with working out what's gone wrong and fixing it.
556 | 2535 | 2534 | Ah here we are. I think we're about to take off again, but I'm sure that nobody's in control. I'd better go down again to secure things, but I'll be back a bit later to help you if I can. I hope you understood most of that, for all our sakes. Good luck, now, good luck! Don't forget to press the button!
557 | 2497 | 2496 | Tidy as you go, tidy as you go.
558 | 2499 | 2498 | Er, I've forgotten what I was going to say. Oh yes. My name is Fentible, I am the DoorBot serving on this the maiden voyage of the Starship Titanic, the ship that cannot possibly, er, go wrong. Now as you can see, the ship, this... thing you see behind me, well, we've had a little accident. Don't worry. No harm done. Just a little scratch to the paintwork I think. Luckily your house was quite soft. I realize this is a bit of an imposition, but we need you urgently. Will you help?
559 | 2501 | 2500 | Hello? Will you help? Hello? Oh, silly me, o strange, deluded, benighted me, you'll need your Personal Electronic Thing. We call it a PET. Here.
560 | 2503 | 2502 | Rather complicated, but I'm sure you'll figure it out. All you need to do now is type in "YES", meaning that you will help, and we can get going. That's "YES. Y. E. S".
561 | 2505 | 2504 | I'm afraid we don't have time to footle around. Will you help? All you need to do is type in "YES".
562 | 2507 | 2506 | An odd way to spell it, but that will do fine. You won't regret it. Well, maybe you will, but let's get you on board anyway.
563 | 2509 | 2508 | Excellent, you won't regret it. Well, maybe you will, but let's get you on board anyway.
564 | 2511 | 2510 | Anything else you want to say or ask, just type.
565 | 2513 | 2512 | Not now, not now, we've got to get you on board.
566 | 2515 | 2514 | Oh look, a nice picture, of the sky above your house. How nice. You should take that with you, you know.
567 | 2521 | 2520 | Oh dear, I can see you're new to having giant interstellar cruise liners crashing into your house. Here, let me show you...
568 | 2517 | 2516 | Good. Now if you just slide it down into your PET it will become part of your personal baggage. We can deal with all that later. Come on!
569 | 2519 | 2518 | That's right, in we go...
570 | 2523 | 2522 | Good. The way this trip is going it may be the last time you'll ever see that particular view. Come on.
571 | 2539 | 2538 | Well, I'll see if I can help. It's a bit complicated for me. If you pass your pointy thing over anything on your PET I'll tell you what I know.
572 | 2541 | 2540 | I'll see if I can help again. What do you need to know about?
573 | 2543 | 2542 | That's your baggage storage area. We encourage passengers to keep their personal effects there rather than in the cabins.
574 | 2545 | 2544 | Those are the codes for all the rooms in the ship. Terribly complicated system if you ask me. You have to drag all sorts of things around and hold down all sorts of buttons. Designer stuff, I'm afraid. Never understood it, but I'm sure you'll figure it out.
575 | 2547 | 2546 | I do know that the room it's showing at the moment is definitely yours.
576 | 2549 | 2548 | To ensure quality customer service, all of our conversations are recorded here, whether customers like it or not.
577 | 2551 | 2550 | If you ever need any help which you think that either the BellBot or myself might be able to provide, then you may summon either of us by pressing on these nice little pictures.
578 | 2553 | 2552 | Ah, now those tell you something about the current mental state of the robot you're talking to.
579 | 2555 | 2554 | This allows you to control a lot of the customer facilities on the ship, if you can figure out how it works. Beats me I'm afraid.
580 | 2557 | 2556 | This is a complete mystery to me. It says you can save the game. What game? I don't know what it's talking about.
581 | 2617 | 2616 | That's the Auditory Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
582 | 2621 | 2620 | That's the Auditory Center. It's a bit of Titania's brain.
583 | 2619 | 2618 | Tremendous! Without it she couldn't understand anything she heard!
584 | 2623 | 2622 | It just deals with ear stuff.
585 | 2609 | 2608 | That's the central intelligence core of Titania's brain.
586 | 2613 | 2612 | That's the Central Intelligence Core of Titania's brain.
587 | 2611 | 2610 | Tremendous! Bit whiffy, but it's still working, that's the main thing!
588 | 2615 | 2614 | It just deals with thinking stuff.
589 | 2577 | 2576 | That's one of Titania's ears.
590 | 2581 | 2580 | That's one of Titania's ears.
591 | 2579 | 2578 | Well done! She'll be delighted to hear you've found it. Or will be once you've found the other one.
592 | 2583 | 2582 | Well, I suppose it's better than a slap round the face with a wet halibut.
593 | 2585 | 2584 | It's one of Titania's ears.
594 | 2589 | 2588 | It's one of Titania's ears.
595 | 2587 | 2586 | Well done! She'll be delighted to hear you've found it. Or will be once you've found the other one.
596 | 2591 | 2590 | Well, I suppose it's better than a slap round the face with an old trout.
597 | 2561 | 2560 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
598 | 2565 | 2564 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
599 | 2563 | 2562 | She'll be glad to see that again. Assuming she's already got the other one, of course.
600 | 2567 | 2566 | Not that there's anything worth seeing.
601 | 2569 | 2568 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
602 | 2573 | 2572 | That's one of Titania's eyes.
603 | 2571 | 2570 | She'll be glad to see that again. Assuming she's already got the other one, of course.
604 | 2575 | 2574 | Not that there's anything worth seeing.
605 | 2593 | 2592 | That's Titania's mouth!
606 | 2597 | 2596 | That's Titania's mouth.
607 | 2595 | 2594 | Brilliant! Not only will she be very pleased, but she'll be able to say so.
608 | 2599 | 2598 | Oh dear. Rabbit rabbit rabbit.
609 | 2601 | 2600 | That's Titania's nose!
610 | 2605 | 2604 | That's Titania's nose.
611 | 2603 | 2602 | I'm so glad you've found it.
612 | 2607 | 2606 | Sniff!
613 | 2625 | 2624 | That's the Olfactory Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
614 | 2629 | 2628 | That's the Olfactory Center. It's a bit of Titania's brain.
615 | 2627 | 2626 | Wonderful! That's for thinking about smells with!
616 | 2631 | 2630 | It just deals with nose stuff.
617 | 2633 | 2632 | That's the Speech Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
618 | 2637 | 2636 | That's the Speech Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
619 | 2635 | 2634 | Wonderful! That's the bit for thinking before you speak. Not a lot of people have one of those.
620 | 2639 | 2638 | It just deals with talk stuff.
621 | 2641 | 2640 | That's the Vision Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
622 | 2645 | 2644 | That's the Vision Center! It's a bit of Titania's brain.
623 | 2643 | 2642 | Excellent! That's the bit that tells her what she's looking at.
624 | 2647 | 2646 | It just deals with the vision thing.
625 | 3957 | 3956 | Seasonal adjustment. It's how you adjust the seasons. What did you think it meant?
626 | 2653 | 2652 | It's a bit of Titania's brain.
627 | 2655 | 2654 | It's a bit of Titania's brain.
628 | 2809 | 2808 | That appears to be the left arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot. It seems to be holding a key to something.
629 | 2813 | 2812 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's left arm. It seems to be holding a key of some kind.
630 | 2811 | 2810 | He's gripping it very tightly.
631 | 2815 | 2814 | He seems to be very tense.
632 | 2825 | 2824 | That appears to be the left arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot.
633 | 2829 | 2828 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's left arm.
634 | 2827 | 2826 | I hope he's not missing it too much!
635 | 2831 | 2830 | I bet he's kicking up a fuss about it.
636 | 2817 | 2816 | That appears to be the right arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot. It seems to be holding part of Titania's brain.
637 | 2821 | 2820 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's right arm. I think it's gripping part of Titania's brain very hard.
638 | 2819 | 2818 | He's gripping it very tightly, isn't he?
639 | 2823 | 2822 | Lord knows why.
640 | 2833 | 2832 | That appears to be the right arm of one of my colleagues, the Maitre d'Bot.
641 | 2837 | 2836 | Oh, dear. That's the Maitre d'Bot's right arm.
642 | 2835 | 2834 | I hope he's not missing it too much!
643 | 2839 | 2838 | I bet he's kicking up a fuss about it.
644 | 2649 | 2648 | Put it back where it belongs! That will really help!
645 | 2651 | 2650 | I suppose you'd better put it back where it belongs. Won't do any good without all the other bits, of course.
646 | 2865 | 2864 | That is an exciting multimedia experience of some kind.
647 | 2869 | 2868 | That's a kind of device for crashing computers with.
648 | 2867 | 2866 | Primitive but fun.
649 | 2871 | 2870 | Easier to use a baseball bat I find.
650 | 2873 | 2872 | That is my entire universe!
651 | 2877 | 2876 | That is my entire universe.
652 | 2875 | 2874 | Strange that you've got it in your baggage.
653 | 2879 | 2878 | Troublesome place I find.
654 | 2721 | 2720 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with mustard sauce.
655 | 2729 | 2728 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with mustard sauce.
656 | 2723 | 2722 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with tomato sauce.
657 | 2731 | 2730 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with tomato sauce.
658 | 2725 | 2724 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with bird sauce.
659 | 2733 | 2732 | That is a piece of chicken. It seems to be smeared with bird sauce.
660 | 2727 | 2726 | Yum yum.
661 | 2735 | 2734 | Filthy stuff.
662 | 2785 | 2784 | That is a phonograph cylinder.
663 | 2789 | 2788 | That is a phonograph cylinder.
664 | 2787 | 2786 | It probably has some music engraved in its grooves.
665 | 2791 | 2790 | It's probably got some dreadful music on it.
666 | 2857 | 2856 | Those are some feathers!
667 | 2861 | 2860 | Those are some feathers.
668 | 2859 | 2858 | From the parrot I believe. You didn't by any chance rip its head off while you were about it did you?
669 | 2863 | 2862 | .. from that horrid parrot.
670 | 2661 | 2660 | I really don't know. The whole ship is stuffed to the gills with electricity. Could be anywhere.
671 | 2667 | 2666 | I don't know. I don't spend a lot of time thinking about fuses.
672 | 2657 | 2656 | That's a sort of fuse.
673 | 2663 | 2662 | That's a sort of fuse.
674 | 2659 | 2658 | I'm sure you'll find a use for it if you like that kind of thing.
675 | 2665 | 2664 | Enjoy.
676 | 2793 | 2792 | That is a glass. It has some tomato sauce in it.
677 | 2801 | 2800 | That is a glass. It has some tomato sauce in it.
678 | 2795 | 2794 | That is a glass. It has some mustard sauce in it.
679 | 2803 | 2802 | That is a glass. It has some mustard sauce in it.
680 | 2797 | 2796 | That is a glass. It has some bird sauce in it.
681 | 2805 | 2804 | That is a glass. It has some bird sauce in it.
682 | 2799 | 2798 | A very delicious condiment, I'm sure.
683 | 2807 | 2806 | People like to smear it on their food. Can't think why.
684 | 2777 | 2776 | That is a hammer.
685 | 2781 | 2780 | That is a hammer.
686 | 2779 | 2778 | An excellent tool for all striking-related tasks.
687 | 2783 | 2782 | The sort of thing you bang your thumb with.
688 | 2753 | 2752 | That is a hosepipe.
689 | 2757 | 2756 | That is a hosepipe.
690 | 2755 | 2754 | I wonder what's happened to the other end of it.
691 | 2759 | 2758 | Or at least part of a hosepipe. Can't rely on anything these days.
692 | 2761 | 2760 | That is the other end of a hosepipe.
693 | 2765 | 2764 | That is the other end of a hosepipe.
694 | 2763 | 2762 | What a strange and incomprehensible object.
695 | 2767 | 2766 | I wish I knew what I even meant by that.
696 | 2841 | 2840 | That's the key to the first class Restaurant music system.
697 | 2845 | 2844 | That's the key to the first class Restaurant music system.
698 | 2843 | 2842 | Music! The secret of happy dining!
699 | 2847 | 2846 | I find music gives me indigestion.
700 | 2769 | 2768 | That is a lemon.
701 | 2773 | 2772 | That is a lemon.
702 | 2771 | 2770 | A fat, juicy and above all, very lemony lemon.
703 | 2775 | 2774 | Nasty, bitter fruit. Makes your mouth go all funny.
704 | 2689 | 2688 | I'm not sure. But if it's here, what's the LiftBot using?
705 | 2691 | 2690 | I don't know. Kick it about a bit?
706 | 2681 | 2680 | That's the head of one of the LiftBots.
707 | 2685 | 2684 | That's the head of one of the LiftBots.
708 | 2683 | 2682 | Well done. That'll be a weight off his shoulders.
709 | 2687 | 2686 | He won't miss it.
710 | 2701 | 2700 | That's an in-flight magazine.
711 | 2705 | 2704 | That's an in-flight magazine.
712 | 2703 | 2702 | Always such interesting articles, I find, don't you? Well maybe not.
713 | 2707 | 2706 | Probably full of drivel.
714 | 2849 | 2848 | That is a napkin!
715 | 2853 | 2852 | That is a napkin!
716 | 2851 | 2850 | A nice, white, crisp one!
717 | 2855 | 2854 | Can't tell you much about it, I'm afraid.
718 | 2745 | 2744 | That is a parrot.
719 | 2749 | 2748 | That is a parrot.
720 | 2747 | 2746 | What a wonderful boon you have performed for us all by capturing it.
721 | 2751 | 2750 | Nauseating creature.
722 | 2737 | 2736 | That is a perch, such as a parrot, in its cage, might sit on.
723 | 2741 | 2740 | That is a parrot's perch.
724 | 2739 | 2738 | And a very lovely perch it is too.
725 | 2743 | 2742 | Horrible bird.
726 | 2677 | 2676 | Well, where's home, there's hope. So don't lose it, that's my advice.
727 | 2679 | 2678 | Look at it wistfully.
728 | 2669 | 2668 | That's a photograph of the night sky above your lovely home.
729 | 2673 | 2672 | That's a photograph of the night sky above your house.
730 | 2671 | 2670 | What a delightful reminder it must be of... well, of when your home was lovely.
731 | 2675 | 2674 | Last you'll see of that.
732 | 2717 | 2716 | It is the sum of the length of all the sticks in the universe, divided by the number of sticks. I am informed that it was a very tedious calculation.
733 | 2719 | 2718 | I neither know nor care. I do not fraternize with menial stick-counters.
734 | 2709 | 2708 | That is a stick of above average length.
735 | 2713 | 2712 | That is a stick of above average length.
736 | 2711 | 2710 | A must for all stick fans.
737 | 2715 | 2714 | Very nice, I suppose, if you happen to like that sort of thing.
738 | 2693 | 2692 | That's a crushed television set.
739 | 2697 | 2696 | That's a crushed television set.
740 | 2695 | 2694 | Delicious!
741 | 2699 | 2698 | Quite the best sort if you ask me.
742 | 2559 | 2558 | If you look through the different settings on your PET you should find the room you've been assigned to. Click those little picture things on the right hand side of the screen. Fourth one down I think.
743 | 3481 | 3480 | I say! Ouch!
744 | 3491 | 3490 | Ow. Thanks.
745 | 3483 | 3482 | Please don't do that!
746 | 3493 | 3492 | Ouch. I deserved that I suppose.
747 | 3485 | 3484 | Ow! That's not exactly fun you know!
748 | 3495 | 3494 | Ow. You're going to do that again aren't you.
749 | 3487 | 3486 | Please don't prod me. Thank you.
750 | 3497 | 3496 | Ow. Thank you. Very funny.
751 | 3489 | 3488 | I'm afraid if you prod me again I shall just have to go.
752 | 3499 | 3498 | Look I've had enough. One more and I'm off.
753 | 3315 | 3314 | Beats me.
754 | 3915 | 3914 | I wouldn't do that if I were you - might make it sneeze. And you don't want to be around when a Succ-U-Bus sneezes.
755 | 3917 | 3916 | Do that and you'll make it sneeze. Which isn't very nice to be honest.
756 | 3919 | 3918 | That's the Mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Or is that Succ-U-Bi?
757 | 3921 | 3920 | That's the Mother of all Succ-U-Buses. Ugly brute, isn't it.
758 | 3883 | 3882 | Have you managed to disarm that bomb yet?
759 | 3393 | 3392 | Just a thought - but I wonder if you've managed to disarm that bomb yet?
760 | 3395 | 3394 | I suppose that bomb could go off any moment, couldn't it.
761 | 3885 | 3884 | Are you getting anywhere with that bomb or are you just going to pretend it doesn't exist?
762 | 3397 | 3396 | I wonder if I might just re-introduce the words "bomb" and "defuse". I do hope you don't mind.
763 | 3399 | 3398 | Bomb's about to go off. Just thought you might want to know.
764 | 3887 | 3886 | If you don't defuse that bomb soon you're going to blow us all up.
765 | 3889 | 3888 | Can I remind you about the bomb?
766 | 3891 | 3890 | Krage says the bomb's still counting down.
767 | 3875 | 3874 | Nothing worth bothering with.
768 | 3877 | 3876 | That's not important.
769 | 3879 | 3878 | You don't need to bother with that.
770 | 3881 | 3880 | Nothing you need to worry about.
771 | 3309 | 3308 | I don't think you need to bother yourself with that.
772 | 3311 | 3310 | Who knows. Ignore it - maybe it'll go away.
773 | 3313 | 3312 | Can't help you I'm afraid - I've no idea what he's on about.
774 | 3143 | 3142 | Whoops! There go my settings. Wonderful!
775 | 3145 | 3144 | Uh oh! There go my settings.
776 | 3147 | 3146 | Whoops! There go my settings again.
777 | 3149 | 3148 | Uh oh! There go my settings again.
778 | 3375 | 3374 | Cough!
779 | 3605 | 3604 | You want to change my settings just go along to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the right levers. Not that it'll do you any good I'm sure.
780 | 3601 | 3600 | If you want to change my cellpoint settings all you have to do is pop along to the Sculpture Chamber, find the relevant statue and pull the old knobs.
781 | 3607 | 3606 | Don't remember anything about cellpoint settings. I wonder if they're important. Probably.
782 | 3603 | 3602 | Can't for the life of me remember how you change cellpoint settings, but I'm sure if you look around long enough you'll work it out.
783 | 3611 | 3610 | I've no idea but I'm sure a creature of your intelligence won't have any trouble.
784 | 3609 | 3608 | You won't have any trouble at all - I'm told it's rather a good likeness.
785 | 3615 | 3614 | Haven't got a clue. Which means you're not going to be able to help.
786 | 3613 | 3612 | It's quite clear which statue is of me. But I doubt you'll be able to work it out.
787 | 3597 | 3596 | Optimism's low which makes sense given the situation. Memoriousness is high although I'd feel better if it was low.
788 | 3593 | 3592 | Optimism's high, Memoriousness is high and life is pretty wonderful.
789 | 3599 | 3598 | Who knows? Whatever they are they're bound to be at their lowest.
790 | 3595 | 3594 | Can't quite remember my settings but I'm sure they're high.
791 | 3619 | 3618 | Don't ask me. Perhaps they'll stop changing on their own?
792 | 3617 | 3616 | Fix Titania - I imagine that ought to do it.
793 | 3623 | 3622 | Don't remember. Even if I could it would be no use.
794 | 3621 | 3620 | Fix Titania. Some hope of you achieving that though.
795 | 3579 | 3578 | Can't quite remember what they are - but I do know they're a "good thing".
796 | 3577 | 3576 | Wonderful things! Just pull a couple of levers and hey presto ! Your Bot's got a brand new character.
797 | 3583 | 3582 | Can't remember. Sound like a bad thing if you ask me.
798 | 3581 | 3580 | Basically they're character controls for the Bots. Not a good thing if you ask me.
799 | 3587 | 3586 | Can't quite remember - still, I'm sure they're jolly useful.
800 | 3585 | 3584 | Optimism and memoriousness - and jolly fine parameters they are too!
801 | 3591 | 3590 | Who knows? They're bound to be pretty useless whatever they are.
802 | 3589 | 3588 | Pessimism and memoriousness. Typically low key of course.
803 | 3447 | 3446 | Earlier.
804 | 3465 | 3464 | Earlier.
805 | 3923 | 3922 | Jolly good. Have we checked-in yet?
806 | 3925 | 3924 | Might as well check in while you're here. Can't see you'll help much.
807 | 3959 | 3958 | I say - perhaps it's just blown a fuse?
808 | 3961 | 3960 | Typical, eh?
809 | 3773 | 3772 | Ah. Let's go through it step by step.
810 | 3775 | 3774 | Have you tried kicking it?
811 | 3777 | 3776 | Good cos you'll only break it. Have you checked the fuse?
812 | 3779 | 3778 | Mmm. Well if that didn't work have you tried checking the fuse?
813 | 3783 | 3782 | Well there's your answer. Change the fuse.
814 | 3781 | 3780 | You must have put the wrong fuse in. Try another one.
815 | 3907 | 3906 | Would you mind awfully not fiddling with that?
816 | 3909 | 3908 | I say. Please don't fiddle.
817 | 3911 | 3910 | Please don't fiddle. It doesn't help.
818 | 3913 | 3912 | I say. Please don't fiddle. It's just wasting time.
819 | 3513 | 3512 | What?
820 | 3531 | 3530 | Who's she?
821 | 3533 | 3532 | Where's that?
822 | 3535 | 3534 | Where was that again?
823 | 3537 | 3536 | Go where?
824 | 3539 | 3538 | Do what?
825 | 3541 | 3540 | Where?
826 | 3543 | 3542 | Over where?
827 | 3545 | 3544 | Where was that again?
828 | 3547 | 3546 | Why?
829 | 3549 | 3548 | And why was that again?
830 | 3515 | 3514 | The what?
831 | 3551 | 3550 | What about it?
832 | 3553 | 3552 | Oh, I see.
833 | 3555 | 3554 | No, actually.
834 | 3557 | 3556 | Sorry, my memory seems to be playing up.
835 | 3559 | 3558 | I seem to remember that my memory used to be better than this, though with my memory, it's hard to be sure.
836 | 3561 | 3560 | Sorry, memory's gone again.
837 | 3563 | 3562 | Did my memory use to be better than this?
838 | 3565 | 3564 | Yes what?
839 | 3567 | 3566 | Yes please what?
840 | 3569 | 3568 | No what?
841 | 3517 | 3516 | With what?
842 | 3571 | 3570 | No thank you what?
843 | 3573 | 3572 | What were we talking about?
844 | 3575 | 3574 | Oh... and?
845 | 3519 | 3518 | What?
846 | 3521 | 3520 | What's that?
847 | 3523 | 3522 | Which one?
848 | 3525 | 3524 | Which?
849 | 3527 | 3526 | Who?
850 | 3529 | 3528 | Who's he?
851 | 3319 | 3318 | Lot of fuss about nothing.
852 | 3321 | 3320 | I think they call it galloid charm. I'm rather impervious to it myself.
853 | 3931 | 3930 | Yes? To be honest I'm getting a bit tired of this.
854 | 3933 | 3932 | Ooh. Make your mind up - I'll get ill if you keep doing this.
855 | 3689 | 3688 | Have you been up to the First Class Restaurant?
856 | 3691 | 3690 | Have you looked around the First Class Staterooms?
857 | 3693 | 3692 | Have you had a proper look round your Second Class Stateroom?
858 | 3695 | 3694 | Have you been to the Arboretum yet?
859 | 3697 | 3696 | Have you visited the Bilge Room yet?
860 | 3699 | 3698 | Have you been down to the Bottom of the Well yet?
861 | 3723 | 3722 | Have you worked out how to get to the Bridge?
862 | 3725 | 3724 | You reach it from Titania's Room, but until she's fixed, I suspect the access is closed.
863 | 3709 | 3708 | Have you been up the Grand Axial Canal?
864 | 3701 | 3700 | Have you been to the Creators Chamber?
865 | 3705 | 3704 | Have you been back to the Embarkation Lobby?
866 | 3703 | 3702 | Have you been using the elevators?
867 | 3707 | 3706 | Have you had a proper talk with Marsinta?
868 | 3711 | 3710 | Have you been to the Music Room yet?
869 | 3713 | 3712 | Have you had a look at the Promenade Deck yet?
870 | 3715 | 3714 | Have you had a look at the Sculpture Chamber?
871 | 3717 | 3716 | Did you visit the SGT Lounge?
872 | 3719 | 3718 | Did you have a proper look at the SGT Restaurant?
873 | 3721 | 3720 | Have you seen Titania's Room?
874 | 3735 | 3734 | the First Class Restaurant?
875 | 3737 | 3736 | the First Class Staterooms?
876 | 3739 | 3738 | the Second Class Staterooms?
877 | 3741 | 3740 | the Arboretum?
878 | 3743 | 3742 | the Bilge Room?
879 | 3745 | 3744 | the Bottom of the Well?
880 | 3755 | 3754 | the Grand Axial Canal?
881 | 3747 | 3746 | the Creators Chamber?
882 | 3751 | 3750 | the Embarkation Lobby?
883 | 3749 | 3748 | the elevators - have you tried all the floors yet?
884 | 3753 | 3752 | Marsinta - have you had a chat with her yet?
885 | 3757 | 3756 | the Music Room?
886 | 3759 | 3758 | the Promenade Deck?
887 | 3761 | 3760 | the Sculpture Chamber?
888 | 3763 | 3762 | the SGT Lounge?
889 | 3765 | 3764 | the SGT Restaurant?
890 | 3767 | 3766 | Titania's Room?
891 | 3649 | 3648 | Well, it just might be worth having a look around the First Class Restaurant.
892 | 3255 | 3254 | It's rather a charming tableau don't you think? I'd look for clues if I were you.
893 | 3257 | 3256 | I'd stay on the right side of that Maitre d'Bot if I were you.
894 | 3247 | 3246 | This is your wondrous stateroom. Splendid lighting don't you think?
895 | 3249 | 3248 | A room's a room isn't it. Lighting's a bit harsh if you ask me.
896 | 3651 | 3650 | Maybe you should check out some of the First Class Staterooms.
897 | 3239 | 3238 | It's a delightful environment but I suspect you'd be even happier in your room.
898 | 3241 | 3240 | It's a lobby. I don't think there's much in the way of entertainment here to be honest.
899 | 3243 | 3242 | This is your delightful stateroom. Lots of yummy things to eat if you ask me.
900 | 3245 | 3244 | 2nd Class Rooms are 2nd class rooms. If I were you I'd think about how to get an upgrade.
901 | 3653 | 3652 | Maybe you ought to have another look round your Second Class Stateroom.
902 | 3655 | 3654 | Why don't you see what's happening in the Arboretum?
903 | 3251 | 3250 | I'd get chatting to the delightful Fortillian if you ask me.
904 | 3253 | 3252 | Not much to do here apart from talk to the BarBot. Quaint they call him in the brochure. That's a matter of opinion.
905 | 3657 | 3656 | Maybe you should go see the Bilge Room?
906 | 2917 | 2916 | I suspect that Succ-U-Bus is blocked you know. Perhaps there's some way you can make it blow everything out.
907 | 2919 | 2918 | I suppose you could try and get that Succ-U-Bus working.
908 | 3659 | 3658 | Maybe you should have another look in the Bilge Room?
909 | 2921 | 2920 | Quickly. Search the body.
910 | 2923 | 2922 | I suppose there might be something in his pockets.
911 | 3203 | 3202 | This is where all the ship's rubbish turns up. Anything that gets lost in the Succ-U-Bus system.
912 | 3205 | 3204 | This is where all the rubbish turns up. Can't be long before I'm down here on a permanent basis.
913 | 3661 | 3660 | You've not been down to the Bottom of the Well yet have you? So now's a good time to do it.
914 | 3687 | 3686 | Of course, it's the Bridge you really need to reach, but you'll have to fix Titania first to get access.
915 | 3669 | 3668 | Have you been up to the Grand Axial Canal? There's a lot to see up there all right.
916 | 3663 | 3662 | Have you had a good look in the Creators Chamber? I hear there's some odd stuff in there all right.
917 | 3219 | 3218 | This room is really for top brass - full of secrets and codes if you ask me.
918 | 3221 | 3220 | This place is very dodgy - Leovinus, Scraliontis and Brobostigon set this one up for pow wows.
919 | 3207 | 3206 | This is where you check in. And of course chat with the delightful Marsinta.
920 | 3209 | 3208 | This is where you check in. And get mugged by Marsinta if her cellpoint settings have gone squiffy.
921 | 2925 | 2924 | I think you should have a good shufty round the ship. Get your bearings.
922 | 2927 | 2926 | I don't know. Wander around see what happens I suppose.
923 | 2987 | 2986 | Practice, practice, practice.
924 | 2989 | 2988 | Don't really know. Rather wish I hadn't now.
925 | 2983 | 2982 | I do hope so - in fact that's rather what I had in mind when I asked you on board.
926 | 2985 | 2984 | That was the general idea. But somehow looking at you I doubt you'll be up to it.
927 | 3665 | 3664 | You should use the elevator a bit more - have a proper look round the ship.
928 | 2971 | 2970 | Of course "lost" is only relative isn't it?
929 | 2973 | 2972 | A thing's only lost if somebody's looking for it. And I doubt if anybody' s looking for us.
930 | 3667 | 3666 | Why not visit the Embarkation Lobby and have a chat with Marsinta?
931 | 3671 | 3670 | Why not go up to the Music Room? Damn sight better music than the stuff they pipe in here.
932 | 2991 | 2990 | Couple of nails, quick coat of paint it'll be good as new.
933 | 2993 | 2992 | Leave it as we found it - that's the Starlight way.
934 | 3769 | 3768 | Well perhaps you should give it a go.
935 | 3771 | 3770 | Maybe you ought to check it out then.
936 | 2933 | 2932 | I'd pick up that stick if I were you. You need to find something to distract the parrot.
937 | 3215 | 3214 | This slightly unfinished room appears to have a delightfully entertaining parrot in it.
938 | 3217 | 3216 | This room's a bit odd if you ask me. Parrots, sticks, funny perches.
939 | 3727 | 3726 | Ah well. What about.
940 | 3729 | 3728 | I see. Well what about.
941 | 3731 | 3730 | Right. How about.
942 | 3733 | 3732 | Mmm. What about.
943 | 3673 | 3672 | You've not been up to the Promenade Deck yet. You know you really should pay it a visit.
944 | 3675 | 3674 | I think a visit to the Sculpture Chamber is long overdue.
945 | 3223 | 3222 | Now I have to express a personal interest in this room - pull a few levers and you'll see why.
946 | 3225 | 3224 | Dodgiest piece of engineering Leovinus ever came up with if you ask me. Pull some levers and you'll soon see why.
947 | 2913 | 2912 | Just hold tight for the ride.
948 | 2915 | 2914 | Shut your eyes and hope.
949 | 3231 | 3230 | Relax, just relax.
950 | 3233 | 3232 | I don't know. Just sit and look I suppose.
951 | 3227 | 3226 | This is where the SGT bedrooms are, all nicely stacked one on top of the other.
952 | 3229 | 3228 | Sardine city if you ask me - these are the bucket shop bedrooms. Stack 'em high sell 'em cheap I believe is the general notion.
953 | 3677 | 3676 | If you didn't visit the SGT Lounge, well maybe you should go back and have another look.
954 | 3679 | 3678 | You know, the SGT Restaurant might hold a clue.
955 | 3235 | 3234 | If I were you I'd experiment with some of the Starship Titanic's delightful chicken sauce cuisine.
956 | 3237 | 3236 | Only thing to do here is eat chicken.
957 | 2955 | 2954 | Much as I'd love to, that's the BellBot's job.
958 | 2957 | 2956 | BellBots do that. They'll have me doing it soon I suppose.
959 | 3681 | 3680 | You've missed out on one of the highlights of the ship - Titania's Room.
960 | 3683 | 3682 | I know you've already been to Titania's Room but it's still worth another visit.
961 | 3685 | 3684 | Head up to the Top of the Well - get things in perspective.
962 | 3211 | 3210 | This is where you take an elevator - or enjoy the visual delights of Titania's Chamber.
963 | 3213 | 3212 | This is where the elevators are. And Titania's Chamber.
964 | 2929 | 2928 | I'd go up those steps if I were you. Have a good look round Titania's chamber - it's out of bounds for us Bots.
965 | 2931 | 2930 | Go up the steps and have a look in Titania's Chamber. You've got nothing to lose, have you.
966 | 2935 | 2934 | Just a little trouble on takeoff from Blerontis that's all.
967 | 2937 | 2936 | Turmoil, catastrophe, disaster. The usual really.
968 | 2967 | 2966 | Blerontis is - well, behind us, I suppose.
969 | 2969 | 2968 | Could be anywhere. We're lost old chum.
970 | 2951 | 2950 | Ask a LiftBot. They're awfully helpful.
971 | 2953 | 2952 | Ask a LiftBot. They might help if you're lucky.
972 | 2947 | 2946 | The glorious Starship Titanic elevators can be summoned at the Top of the Well.
973 | 2949 | 2948 | Elevators? Top of the Well.
974 | 2999 | 2998 | Of course, of course!
975 | 3001 | 3000 | For what it's worth...
976 | 2943 | 2942 | Oh that's an easy one. Just have a look at the designer room code in your PET.
977 | 2945 | 2944 | The designer room code is in your PET. Or at least it should be.
978 | 2995 | 2994 | We were just about to pick up the passengers in Vastan when we got lost. Well, slightly lost.
979 | 2997 | 2996 | There aren't any passengers because we got lost before we could pick them up.
980 | 2963 | 2962 | We're going to Vastan - soon as this little hiccup's out of the way.
981 | 2965 | 2964 | We were going to Vastan. Now we're just drifting in space.
982 | 2959 | 2958 | Bit of an oversight there I'm afraid. Still, I'm sure you'll be able to hold on till the trip's over.
983 | 2961 | 2960 | Forgot them didn't they. Typical.
984 | 2939 | 2938 | Blerontin.
985 | 2941 | 2940 | Blerontin.
986 | 2979 | 2978 | Just a small case of missing brain parts. Nothing to worry about I'm sure.
987 | 2981 | 2980 | Someone's nicked all the intelligent bits from inside her head and hidden them. To put it bluntly.
988 | 2975 | 2974 | And jolly helpful it is to know that.
989 | 2977 | 2976 | Doesn't mean much if you don't know where Earth is.
990 | 3429 | 3428 | Simple enough! Just figure out why the old girl's not functioning - then fix it. Couldn't be easier!
991 | 3431 | 3430 | If I knew that I wouldn't have got you on board would I.
992 | 3451 | 3450 | If you hurry you might just make it.
993 | 3469 | 3468 | If you hurry you might just make it.
994 | 3795 | 3794 | (humming)
995 | 3797 | 3796 | (humming)
996 | 3799 | 3798 | (humming)
997 | 3801 | 3800 | (humming)
998 | 3803 | 3802 | Do get a move on please. Thank you. Hmmm.
999 | 3805 | 3804 | Oh, dear. Hummm... Boring boring boring...
1000 | 3807 | 3806 | I'm so bored. You're boring me... Could you get a move on please... Could you please hurry up a moment. Thank you.
1001 | 3809 | 3808 | Yes yes yes. Please please. Oh, for goodness sake do hurry up.
1002 | 3811 | 3810 | Well, if you don't need me any more, I'll be off...
1003 | 3927 | 3926 | Everything in order, Sir, Madam, or Other? May I be of assistance?
1004 | 3929 | 3928 | Don't suppose you want any help, do you?
1005 | 2889 | 2888 | Look on the bright side - things can only get better can't they.
1006 | 2891 | 2890 | If you're looking for things to get better, you've come to the wrong place.
1007 | 2885 | 2884 | That's what we like to call the Titanic Effect kicking in.
1008 | 2887 | 2886 | Well, it's downhill from here, I'm afraid.
1009 | 3439 | 3438 | Immediately.
1010 | 3457 | 3456 | Immediately.
1011 | 3441 | 3440 | Right away.
1012 | 3459 | 3458 | Right away.
1013 | 2905 | 2904 | How utterly marvelous for you.
1014 | 2907 | 2906 | Mmm. Fat lot of good you're going to be then.
1015 | 3449 | 3448 | Just missed it.
1016 | 3467 | 3466 | Just missed it.
1017 | 3445 | 3444 | Later.
1018 | 3463 | 3462 | Later.
1019 | 3003 | 3002 | Lift 1,
1020 | 3005 | 3004 | Lift 2,
1021 | 3007 | 3006 | Lift 3,
1022 | 3009 | 3008 | Lift 4,
1023 | 3317 | 3316 | Lord knows.
1024 | 3901 | 3900 | Just hop in one of the mini-elevators. I believe you're on the second tier.
1025 | 3905 | 3904 | Second floor. You'll have to use the mini-elevator.
1026 | 3899 | 3898 | Just hop in one of the mini-elevators. I believe you're on the third tier.
1027 | 3903 | 3902 | Third floor. You'll have to use the mini-elevator.
1028 | 2909 | 2908 | What a delightful name that is.
1029 | 2911 | 2910 | A name's a name I suppose.
1030 | 3413 | 3412 | All in a day's work for a happy Bot!
1031 | 3415 | 3414 | All right.
1032 | 3417 | 3416 | My pleasure any time!
1033 | 3419 | 3418 | My pleasure, I suppose.
1034 | 3421 | 3420 | Anything else I can do to help, don't hesitate to ask!
1035 | 3423 | 3422 | You want anything else, I'm here I suppose.
1036 | 3893 | 3892 | My pleasure.
1037 | 3895 | 3894 | No trouble at all.
1038 | 3897 | 3896 | Glad I could help.
1039 | 3379 | 3378 | Edmund.
1040 | 3387 | 3386 | Edmund.
1041 | 3377 | 3376 | Edmund Lucy Fentible.
1042 | 3385 | 3384 | Edmund Lucy Fentible.
1043 | 3383 | 3382 | Fentible.
1044 | 3391 | 3390 | Fentible.
1045 | 3381 | 3380 | Lucy.
1046 | 3389 | 3388 | Lucy.
1047 | 3437 | 3436 | Never.
1048 | 3455 | 3454 | Never.
1049 | 2897 | 2896 | The feeling is utterly mutual.
1050 | 2899 | 2898 | I'll reserve judgement on that.
1051 | 2893 | 2892 | It's always nice weather on the Starship Titanic.
1052 | 2895 | 2894 | Thing about weather - it's bound to get worse eventually.
1053 | 3095 | 3094 | 1.
1054 | 3113 | 3112 | 10.
1055 | 3115 | 3114 | 11.

1117 | 3625 | 3624 | Not that it will do any good of course.
1118 | 3643 | 3642 | I don't know. Spend your life working it all out. Then you die.
1119 | 3645 | 3644 | I do feel very pessimistic at the moment you know.
1120 | 3647 | 3646 | I find it very hard to look on the bright side at the moment.
1121 | 3627 | 3626 | Won't help, though.
1122 | 3629 | 3628 | I can't see any of this is going to help.
1123 | 3631 | 3630 | None of this is going to help so I don't see why I bother.
1124 | 3633 | 3632 | Why do I bother? This isn't going to help.
1125 | 3635 | 3634 | This is all a waste of time.
1126 | 3637 | 3636 | I wonder when the bomb is going to go off.
1127 | 3639 | 3638 | I wonder when we're going to crash.
1128 | 3641 | 3640 | Well, we've all got to die sometime.
1129 | 3155 | 3154 | Just stand outside any room then look in the designer room number mode of your PET and you'll find out exactly where your are.
1130 | 3157 | 3156 | You probably won't understand this. Stand outside a room then look in the PET. If you're lucky it'll tell you where you are.
1131 | 3505 | 3504 | You want to be careful who you go around prodding.
1132 | 3507 | 3506 | Most of us Bots don't respond well to being prodded.
1133 | 3509 | 3508 | You prod Bots at your peril.
1134 | 3511 | 3510 | You really shouldn't prod Bots - you never know what will happen.
1135 | 3259 | 3258 | How exciting! I do hope so!
1136 | 3261 | 3260 | Probably. Somebody's idea of a joke if you ask me.
1137 | 3813 | 3812 | Did you find the chicken?
1138 | 3829 | 3828 | Did you sort the music out?
1139 | 3831 | 3830 | Did you figure out what happened in the First Class Restaurant?
1140 | 3833 | 3832 | Did you find anything in the Bilge Room?
1141 | 3835 | 3834 | Did you sort out the fuses in Titania's Room?
1142 | 3815 | 3814 | Did you find the napkin?
1143 | 3837 | 3836 | Have you been sneezing?
1144 | 3853 | 3852 | Have you found Titania's Vision Center yet?
1145 | 3855 | 3854 | Have you found Titania's Olfactory Center yet?
1146 | 3857 | 3856 | Have you found Titania's Speech Center yet?
1147 | 3859 | 3858 | Are you still looking for a long stick?
1148 | 3861 | 3860 | Is it true you've found a body?
1149 | 3841 | 3840 | Somebody has been. I heard it.
1150 | 3839 | 3838 | Please don't. It's terribly unhygienic.
1151 | 3843 | 3842 | Have you found Titania's eyes yet?
1152 | 3845 | 3844 | Have you found Titania's nose yet?
1153 | 3847 | 3846 | Have you found Titania's ears yet?
1154 | 3849 | 3848 | Have you found Titania's mouth yet?
1155 | 3851 | 3850 | Have you found Titania's Auditory Center yet?
1156 | 3817 | 3816 | Did you get that damned chicken machine to work?
1157 | 3863 | 3862 | What about that lemon. Have you got it yet?
1158 | 3865 | 3864 | Did you find any starling puree?
1159 | 3867 | 3866 | Did you find a TV set?
1160 | 3869 | 3868 | What exactly is it you're looking for now?
1161 | 3871 | 3870 | Have you defused that awful bomb yet?
1162 | 3819 | 3818 | Did you find out how to get that damned parrot out of the way?
1163 | 3821 | 3820 | Did you find the room with the moth in it?
1164 | 3823 | 3822 | Did you get your room changed?
1165 | 3825 | 3824 | What's the weather like in the Arboretum?
1166 | 3827 | 3826 | Is it winter or summer?
1167 | 3263 | 3262 | Did you find that thing you were looking for? I do hope so.
1168 | 3265 | 3264 | Still wandering round looking for things? It's not a life is it.
1169 | 3947 | 3946 | I see you've got your in-flight magazine - did you win?!
1170 | 3949 | 3948 | Mmmm. In-flight magazine. How exciting. Did you win?
1171 | 3951 | 3950 | How exciting. You'd better get up to Marsinta and grab your upgrade.
1172 | 3953 | 3952 | Better get your upgrade then.
1173 | 3285 | 3284 | Aah.
1174 | 3305 | 3304 | Prr!
1175 | 3307 | 3306 | Mn.
1176 | 3267 | 3266 | Haaah.
1177 | 3287 | 3286 | Aaaaaaahhhrh.
1178 | 3269 | 3268 | Hmmm.
1179 | 3289 | 3288 | Oooooohhh.
1180 | 3271 | 3270 | Aaahh.
1181 | 3291 | 3290 | Oooooooohhh.
1182 | 3273 | 3272 | Oooh.
1183 | 3293 | 3292 | Hmm!
1184 | 3275 | 3274 | Aah.
1185 | 3295 | 3294 | Ooooh.
1186 | 3277 | 3276 | Oooh.
1187 | 3297 | 3296 | Hn!
1188 | 3279 | 3278 | Uh haaah.
1189 | 3299 | 3298 | Hnn!
1190 | 3281 | 3280 | Ahhh.
1191 | 3301 | 3300 | Huh.
1192 | 3283 | 3282 | Oooh.
1193 | 3303 | 3302 | Buh!
1194 | 3969 | 3968 |  
1195 | 3443 | 3442 | Soon.
1196 | 3461 | 3460 | Soon.
1197 | 3501 | 3500 | Didn't catch that I'm afraid?
1198 | 3503 | 3502 | Was that a comment?
1199 | 3967 | 3966 | Super-galactic what??
1200 | 3401 | 3400 | But look! We're already there!
1201 | 3403 | 3402 | We're there. It's no great shakes is it.
1202 | 3191 | 3190 | I can certainly tell you how to get there. Where was it again?
1203 | 3193 | 3192 | I'll tell you how to get there and if you're lucky I'll meet you there. Where was it again?
1204 | 3409 | 3408 | Oh thank you!
1205 | 3411 | 3410 | Mmm. Thanks.
1206 | 3943 | 3942 | Super Galactic Traveler Class!
1207 | 3945 | 3944 | Super Galactic Traveler Class. Riff-raff class would be more appropriate.
1208 | 3195 | 3194 | My behind, I expect.
1209 | 3197 | 3196 | Knowing my luck it's Krage. He has this tiresome habit of creeping up on one.
1210 | 3873 | 3872 | What are you going to do now then?
1211 | 3433 | 3432 | Time you got a move on if you don't mind me saying.
1212 | 3435 | 3434 | Who cares. Time doesn't matter any more.
1213 | 2901 | 2900 | I'm the DoorBot - factotum to the stars.
1214 | 2903 | 2902 | I'm the DoorBot - otherwise known as lackey or slave.
1215 | 3453 | 3452 | Whenever you like.
1216 | 3471 | 3470 | Whenever you like.
1217 | 3477 | 3476 | Try the Bar.
1218 | 3479 | 3478 | Bar I suppose.
1219 | 3473 | 3472 | Just pop along to the restaurant.
1220 | 3475 | 3474 | Ever thought of going to the restaurant?
1221 | 3935 | 3934 | In the Parrot Lobby??
1222 | 3937 | 3936 | In the Parrot Lobby??
1223 | 3163 | 3162 | In the Bar.
1224 | 3165 | 3164 | In the Bar if you're lucky.
1225 | 3187 | 3186 | Oh he's around somewhere. Just summon him with your PET.
1226 | 3189 | 3188 | You could try summoning him with your PET but he's probably having a quiet snooze somewhere.
1227 | 3159 | 3158 | In the Embarkation Lobby.
1228 | 3161 | 3160 | In the Embarkation Lobby - if you're lucky.
1229 | 3179 | 3178 | In the Elevator.
1230 | 3181 | 3180 | In the Elevator. Poor sod.
1231 | 3175 | 3174 | In the 1st Class Restaurant.
1232 | 3177 | 3176 | In the 1st Class Restaurant. Least, he should be.
1233 | 3167 | 3166 | In the Parrot Lobby.
1234 | 3171 | 3170 | In the Parrot Lobby. Just as long as no-one lets it out.
1235 | 3169 | 3168 | Seems to be all over the ship - rather charming isn't it, lends a rather lovely tropical flavor to everything.
1236 | 3173 | 3172 | All over the shop isn't it. As if things weren't bad enough already.
1237 | 3183 | 3182 | On the 1st Class Canal.
1238 | 3185 | 3184 | On the 1st Class Canal. Not that you'll get much out of him.
1239 | 3151 | 3150 | Absolutely! Wonderful idea!
1240 | 3153 | 3152 | I suppose so. If you really want.
1241 | 3785 | 3784 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1242 | 3789 | 3788 | Perhaps somebody took them for safe keeping?
1243 | 3791 | 3790 | Bots aren't allowed into Titania's Room. They fall off the ceiling.
1244 | 3793 | 3792 | Leovinus, Scraliontis, Brobostigon for example.
1245 | 3963 | 3962 | Do you know I think they've got fuse boxes in Titania's chamber.
1246 | 3965 | 3964 | You could always try Titania's chamber. For what it's worth.
1247 | 3787 | 3786 | The ship is controlled from Titania's Room. I expect the fuse box is around there somewhere.
1248 | 3405 | 3404 | You're standing in it. What a thrill!
1249 | 3407 | 3406 | You're in it. Enjoy.
1250 | 3425 | 3424 | Oh here and there! This and that! Things to do! Busy busy!
1251 | 3427 | 3426 | You know. Pottering around. Getting fed up.
1252 | 3327 | 3326 | Brobostigon.
1253 | 3353 | 3352 | Brobostigon.
1254 | 3345 | 3344 | D'Astragaar.
1255 | 3371 | 3370 | D'Astragaar.
1256 | 3939 | 3938 | Dear, dear Edwina. Ah well.
1257 | 3941 | 3940 | Mmmm. Edwina. Rum old thing she was. Let's change the subject shall we?
1258 | 3341 | 3340 | Fentible.
1259 | 3367 | 3366 | Fentible.
1260 | 3339 | 3338 | Fortillian.

1263 | 3357 | 3356 | The Gat.
1264 | 3337 | 3336 | Krage.
1265 | 3363 | 3362 | Krage.
1266 | 3325 | 3324 | Leovinus.
1267 | 3351 | 3350 | Leovinus.
1268 | 3343 | 3342 | Marsinta.
1269 | 3369 | 3368 | Marsinta.

1275 | 3355 | 3354 | Scraliontis.
1276 | 3323 | 3322 | Titania.
1277 | 3349 | 3348 | Titania.
1278 | 3335 | 3334 | You.
1279 | 3361 | 3360 | You.
1280 | 3199 | 3198 | The gloriously infallible engineering giant - Starstruct Incorporated.
1281 | 3201 | 3200 | Some dodgy boat building outfit called Starstruct.
1282 | 3139 | 3138 | The tremendously benign and deeply caring Starlight Lines.
1283 | 3141 | 3140 | Starlight Lines. Although they've probably gone bust by now - given what's happened to the ship.
1284 | 513 | 512 | No, don't think I've ever heard of one of those before.
1285 | 515 | 514 | Sorry, the memory's gone completely.
1286 | 517 | 516 | The trouble with memory loss is that you can never remember if you've had it before.
1287 | 519 | 518 | There's so much I've forgotten. I wish I could remember how much.
1288 | 521 | 520 | No use asking me - I've got a memory like ... one of those things with holes in it that you put, ... er, you know, those things that grow in the, er ... what do you call it...?
1289 | 523 | 522 | If I were you I'd just give up and talk to the what's his name - chappie that looks like a lamp stand.
1290 | 525 | 524 | Afraid we've got a bit of a problem here - the old memory's up the spout and I can't seem to remember any words.
1291 | 495 | 494 | I'm sorry - you'll have to explain that.
1292 | 497 | 496 | My vocabulary has let me down again...
1293 | 499 | 498 | Please explain in words that an old bot might understand.
1294 | 501 | 500 | I'm afraid some of the linguistic complexities of your dear little planet are beyond me.
1295 | 503 | 502 | I'd be awfully grateful if you could simplify that for me.
1296 | 505 | 504 | Just don't understand. Sorry.
1297 | 507 | 506 | Do explain that for me.
1298 | 509 | 508 | What is a - whatever you called it...?
1299 | 511 | 510 | You'll have to bear with me on the old translation front I'm afraid - I'm only a 5.2 and some of the code wasn't very good in the early versions.
1300 | 1097 | 1096 | Sorry. Seem to have forgotten. I'm sure it'll come back to me.
1301 | 1099 | 1098 | Oh dear. Memory problems again. Can't last much longer can it.
1302 | 1101 | 1100 | Memory's gone. Still, I'm sure you'll work out the answer for yourself any minute.
1303 | 1087 | 1086 | How do we get Titania up and running - that's the real question.
1304 | 1089 | 1088 | How do you deal with these bizarre on-board developments - that's a better question.
1305 | 1091 | 1090 | How are we going to get the Titanic working properly, that's what I want to know.
1306 | 1093 | 1092 | How are you going to deal with things when it starts to get difficult, that is a more pertinent question.
1307 | 1095 | 1094 | Don't know the answer to that one but I'm sure things will work out fine.
1308 | 1109 | 1108 | How should I know? Can't remember a damned thing. Par for the course I suppose.
1309 | 1111 | 1110 | How indeed? I wouldn't ask me - memory's shot to pieces and not getting any better.
1310 | 1113 | 1112 | Good question. Don't know's the answer - got no memory you see. Finito. Kaput. Finickety. Tiddly woo. Diddly day doh.
1311 | 1103 | 1102 | How do we get out of here alive. That's a question that's bothering me all right.
1312 | 1105 | 1104 | How did I end up with you. Well I know how. How's it all going to end, that's an even worse question.
1313 | 1107 | 1106 | How did I end up hurtling through hyperspace on an out of control Starship. That old fraudster Fate I suppose.
1314 | 951 | 950 | Memory's all over the shop. I don't think I'm making sense any more.
1315 | 953 | 952 | I'll just have forty winks and see if that helps. Or is it thirty?
1316 | 93 | 92 | Well, one good thing about a bad memory - it can only get better.
1317 | 1401 | 1400 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1318 | 1393 | 1392 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1319 | 1409 | 1408 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1320 | 3 | 2 | Don't know. Hope it's like custard. I think I like custard.
1321 | 11 | 10 | I hadn't noticed but I'm sure the birds will muck in when we ask them.
1322 | 1257 | 1256 | Can't be a bomb on board. I'd have remembered that all right.
1323 | 1291 | 1290 | Reminds me of something that bowl - I'm sure it'll come to me...
1324 | 19 | 18 | Haven't got a clue what that is. I'm sure it'll be jolly useful.
1325 | 27 | 26 | I've not seen any chickens. Still, there might be a spare egg knocking around we could keep our eyes on - depends upon how lucky you're feeling.
1326 | 35 | 34 | Who knows? Perhaps the chickens will tire out eventually and slow down?
1327 | 43 | 42 | Memory problem this end. I'm sure you'll think of something.
1328 | 51 | 50 | Who knows? Perhaps one day a chicken will slow down enough to tell you.
1329 | 59 | 58 | From the look of him his racing days are over. Perhaps you should keep him as a souvenir of this happy holiday.
1330 | 67 | 66 | You're probably right. I'm not sure I had one in the conventional sense.
1331 | 65 | 64 | Well this is a fine time to turn up.
1332 | 707 | 706 | Haven't got a clue what else I do but I don't give a fig because this will make me happy for ever.
1333 | 715 | 714 | As you wish. I don't mind where we go. I can't even remember where we are.
1334 | 723 | 722 | Don't know. Pleasant little ride though isn't it.
1335 | 731 | 730 | Nature is a wonderful thing. I wonder who said that? Me I suppose.
1336 | 739 | 738 | Your guess is as good as mine but let's keep smiling. Expect the best and forget the worst that's what I say. Or did I already say that.
1337 | 747 | 746 | Haven't got a clue but let's have some fun shall we? Go on, press it.
1338 | 755 | 754 | Could be anything: sea-urchin dispenser, quirk analyzer, helium spigot. Seize the day - press it.
1339 | 763 | 762 | Jolly big aren't they. I'm sure they lead somewhere delightful.
1340 | 771 | 770 | I don't know what it is. I know. Let's pretend it's the route to eternal joy.
1341 | 71 | 70 | We'll soon get some more food. Just as soon as I remember what food is.
1342 | 395 | 394 | What a delight to see you once again. Whoever you are.
1343 | 413 | 412 | Sir, Madam or other. How may I be of assistance?
1344 | 397 | 396 | Have we met? How can I help you?
1345 | 399 | 398 | Unknown guest. It's pleasure unbridled to be here at your service.
1346 | 401 | 400 | I don't believe we've met, but how may I be of service on this joyously lovely day?
1347 | 403 | 402 | Greetings stranger. Fentible's here, his only desire to serve.
1348 | 405 | 404 | Welcome to the Starship Titanic. Here I am, DoorBot at your service.
1349 | 407 | 406 | Hello - whoever you are. DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1350 | 409 | 408 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot at your service.
1351 | 411 | 410 | Sir, Madam or other. Fentible, at your service.
1352 | 457 | 456 | Memory's gone again - Krage will know. Ask him.
1353 | 1385 | 1384 | Here's a piece of advice that'll keep you happy. Don't forget to hang on to your memory.
1354 | 79 | 78 | No... you've lost me there. We'll soon pick up the old thread though don't you worry... what was I saying?... No. Gone again.
1355 | 1003 | 1002 | I can't quite remember where we're going but you can be assured we'll be off shortly.
1356 | 1011 | 1010 | There's no time to hang around - don't ask me why because for the life of me I can't remember.
1357 | 1019 | 1018 | I presume it's something rather important that's fallen out of my brain. Still, better out than in eh?
1358 | 1027 | 1026 | I'm sure you'll get used to it. I certainly have. In fact I've forgotten it already.
1359 | 1035 | 1034 | Looks like some sort of video controller doesn't it. I'm sure it'll come in handy.
1360 | 1043 | 1042 | No. Not a clue. Sorry. Perhaps there'll be some party games with the other passengers?
1361 | 1051 | 1050 | Look on the bright side. Although I can't really remember why you should.
1362 | 1059 | 1058 | Something rather unnecessary appears to have happened although bless me I have little recollection of the event. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible - if I can remember how.
1363 | 1377 | 1376 | What a charming notion. Can't quite remember who our leader is today so we'll just pretend it's me shall we?
1364 | 87 | 86 | That should be easy. Sadly I've forgotten how.
1365 | 1329 | 1328 | Well you'll be missing an absolute beano. Don't ask me why though, because I can't remember.
1366 | 1331 | 1330 | Well you'll be missing an absolute beano. Seems an awful lot to spend for the 2 minute version.
1367 | 99 | 98 | Maybe it's sulking and any moment now it's going to have a change of heart.
1368 | 107 | 106 | So there's a cage as well now is there? Ah well, we must be over the worst by now.
1369 | 115 | 114 | Is there a parrot on board? How delightful.
1370 | 131 | 130 | Don't remember seeing any on board. Which reminds me, I've not eaten. Perhaps I don't. That's one less thing to worry about.
1371 | 139 | 138 | Who knows. Perhaps it's just hungry.
1372 | 147 | 146 | Couldn't tell you. It looks like a helpful sort of bird though doesn't he?
1373 | 163 | 162 | I'm sure there's a way but I've forgotten it. We'll think of something don't you worry.
1374 | 171 | 170 | Haven't got a clue. I suppose you could try asking it.
1375 | 179 | 178 | Caught me on a bad memory day it would seem. Are you my mother?
1376 | 187 | 186 | Good Lord you're right! There's a parrot! Perhaps it's part of a display team?
1377 | 1307 | 1306 | If there's a parrot on board, I'm sure he'll turn up eventually.
1378 | 1325 | 1324 | Who knows.
1379 | 779 | 778 | Who knows. Perhaps we could use them to clone another parrot to ask this one what he's doing?
1380 | 123 | 122 | You've got me there. I'd start with the old carbon-based diet first and work your way up to Mercilium.
1381 | 155 | 154 | Never seen it before. Do you think it'll sing us a song?
1382 | 787 | 786 | Looks like a nose doesn't it. I'm not sure we need one but it's a start isn't it?
1383 | 795 | 794 | Don't ask me. Perhaps if there's a fancy dress party I could wear it?
1384 | 803 | 802 | Could be a Rabelok monkey trap for all I know. Looks like it could come in handy later though..
1385 | 811 | 810 | I don't know why you'd want to do that but if it makes you happy.
1386 | 819 | 818 | Couldn't tell you what it is. Still, take it with you it's bound to come in handy.
1387 | 827 | 826 | Sounds awfully like a Rapulon to me. Could be a Monkey-eating Plenge. Or is it a Titherer. Whatever: I expect someone will come and shoot it in a second.
1388 | 835 | 834 | Are we getting a parrot? That's jolly exciting.
1389 | 843 | 842 | Who knows? I'm sure It'll be happy though.
1390 | 851 | 850 | Don't ask me. I'm sure whatever you do will turn out to be the right thing in the end.
1391 | 859 | 858 | Don't recognize any of it but I'm hoping there might be a little cooking program on later.
1392 | 867 | 866 | Haven't got a clue but perhaps the little fellow's trying to help you.
1393 | 195 | 194 | Whatever they are I'm sure we'll have some on board somewhere.
1394 | 1299 | 1298 | Don't know, but I'm pretty certain he'll have a good go at it.
1395 | 203 | 202 | Not a clue, not a clue. But I know you'll find it - you're a real trooper.
1396 | 1269 | 1268 | Can't say I know what puree is but it certainly has a birdy sort of air.
1397 | 1271 | 1270 | That's bird puree all right but I wouldn't make a song and dance about it.
1398 | 1273 | 1272 | You mentioned starlings a while back didn't you. If I'm not mistaken, they're a kind of fish and not a particularly good one at that. Don't swim very well.
1399 | 1275 | 1274 | I'd hazard a guess at bird sauce but what's the advice of a lowly DoorBot worth eh?.
1400 | 211 | 210 | That's a tough one. I'm sure you'll think of something.
1401 | 219 | 218 | If you know a good way to do it, then I'd say tally-ho!
1402 | 1347 | 1346 | Well it's anyone's guess. I'm pretty resilient and whatever happens I won't stop smiling.
1403 | 331 | 330 | I'm sure someone will be along shortly to take your order.
1404 | 363 | 362 | Haven't a clue but I'm sure you'll have a lot of fun finding out.
1405 | 323 | 322 | I'm sure it's just a little floor show.
1406 | 347 | 346 | Whatever it is I'm sure a couple of espresso's will have him back on his feet.
1407 | 355 | 354 | I know there was a lot of to-ing and fro-ing last night but I just can't remember who. I'm sure he'll be up and about in a minute.
1408 | 339 | 338 | I don't know who it is but he's obviously enjoyed his meal.
1409 | 227 | 226 | Jolly good idea. I'll get right onto it - as soon as I can remember what it is I'm supposed to be doing.
1410 | 235 | 234 | Another DoorBot? Joy of joys! We must meet. There's so much to say!
1411 | 875 | 874 | Pleasant looking woman. Can't say I know her. Maybe it's my wife. I wonder if Bots have wives. I'm sure I deserve one. I'm sure I'm a decent sort of Bot when I'm working properly.
1412 | 885 | 884 | Don't know what happens but I'm happy just to be sharing this special time with you.
1413 | 893 | 892 | Who knows? If this is the wrong room I'm sure someone will tell you.
1414 | 901 | 900 | I'm not really the best judge of that - I'm sure it'll feel bigger when you've lived in it a little.
1415 | 1363 | 1362 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me. He'll be right as rain any moment I'm sure.
1416 | 909 | 908 | Don't know what they are but they look jolly edible to me.
1417 | 917 | 916 | Who knows? They look yummy though.
1418 | 937 | 936 | Don't know. Can't do any harm, can it?
1419 | 243 | 242 | Ugly beggar isn't it. Couldn't tell you what it is but I'm sure it's going to come in jolly handy.
1420 | 251 | 250 | Haven't got a clue but what harm can it do to try?
1421 | 259 | 258 | Well it's anyone's guess. I'm pretty resilient and whatever happens I won't stop smiling.
1422 | 1281 | 1280 | Not sure if I do that sort of thing. Let's have a shot at it shall we.
1423 | 267 | 266 | Are we going somewhere? How exciting!
1424 | 275 | 274 | Titanic. Titanic. No, I'm afraid the word means nothing to me. Let me hazard a guess. Some sort of lozenge? An ear refreshment spray? A variety of condiment? I'll get there in the end I always do. I think.
1425 | 283 | 282 | Not exactly Mr. MemoryBot today. I'm sure you'll come up with a plan.
1426 | 291 | 290 | I don't know where you're supposed to be but I'm sure it'll all turn out right in the wash.
1427 | 963 | 962 | Do you know something - this all looks terribly familiar, as if I've been here before. Ah well. Give it a try - nothing ventured...
1428 | 971 | 970 | I'm fairly certain jumping's not the answer. Although who knows - they say flying's all in the mind don't they.
1429 | 979 | 978 | Elevators? Holy Kaboli! They'll come in handy - let's go for a ride.
1430 | 995 | 994 | I think she's rather important but I seem to have forgotten the details.
1431 | 987 | 986 | Who knows. Perhaps someone's putting on a show - oh I do hope so.
1432 | 1371 | 1370 | Can't quite remember the old emergency drill today. Let's just ignore him - he'll probably go away.
1433 | 299 | 298 | Never heard of it. Perhaps there's a CopBot you can ask?
1434 | 307 | 306 | If you want to know where to go, I wouldn't ask me. I'm sure you'll find someone more useful out there.
1435 | 315 | 314 | No. It's gone. Had it for a second. Lost it. It'll come back. Don't you worry.
1436 | 489 | 488 | Never heard of him. Sounds Galloid to me - which is always exciting.
1437 | 481 | 480 | Never heard of him. Sounds jolly exciting though.
1438 | 1355 | 1354 | Could be the king of Kalpon for all I know. He'll wake up in a second and tell us.
1439 | 473 | 472 | Never heard of him. Sounds a nice sort of fellow whoever he is.
1440 | 465 | 464 | Never heard of her. But she sounds lovely.
1441 | 1339 | 1338 | I wonder if it always does that. I thought it was rather fun actually.
1442 | 1399 | 1398 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1443 | 1391 | 1390 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1444 | 1407 | 1406 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1445 | 1279 | 1278 | With respect, you'll find the BellBot is the expert on taking - me I'm more a door opening sort of fellow.
1446 | 1 | 0 | Well it's a delightful, rich, pungent dressing whose origin and constituent parts are a closely guarded secret and which balances the taste and texture of chicken in a manner which is almost miraculous.
1447 | 9 | 8 | I had noticed this in passing but prefer to avoid such speciesist labels and think of us all as one big happy crew.
1448 | 1255 | 1254 | There's no bomb on this ship. Good lord no.
1449 | 1289 | 1288 | It may look like a bowl but I do believe it's one of Titania's ears.
1450 | 17 | 16 | Each room has a unique identifier and I think we're all going to have a lot of fun remembering them.
1451 | 25 | 24 | The restaurants of the Starship Titanic harbor a veritable cornucopia of chicken, all of which have satisfied the rigorous quality testing of Hen Galactica in order to provide you with that unique 'Farmyard Experience'.
1452 | 33 | 32 | Just change the chicken delivery velocity and everything will be hunky dory.
1453 | 41 | 40 | I've come across this problem before: just find something to wipe the chicken and you'll be fine and dandy.
1454 | 49 | 48 | Just pop up to Titania's Chamber, adjust the old settings and Lob's your uncle.
1455 | 57 | 56 | I think you should post it to the Parrot Room toute suite. That'll sort him out.
1456 | 705 | 704 | This is but one of my diverse responsibilities and I confidently expect it to lead to greater things.
1457 | 713 | 712 | As you wish. Every experience is a rich one if you look at it with a positive default.
1458 | 721 | 720 | I love it down here - peaceful, quiet. A bot can dream a little.
1459 | 729 | 728 | Nature is a wonderful thing. Ah the memories of the old Bloxite mines!
1460 | 737 | 736 | We're going to check you in for the voyage of a lifetime.
1461 | 745 | 744 | Why don't you just press it then sit back and prepare to be excited.
1462 | 753 | 752 | Let me introduce one of my charming colleagues: our delightful DeskBot who will check you in.
1463 | 761 | 760 | You won't be needing the embarkation doors till we land - and according to the brochure I'm expecting paradise...
1464 | 769 | 768 | It's the service elevator but don't you worry you'll be using the grand central elevator system from here.
1465 | 69 | 68 | I'm sure it's only smorbits away from an upgrade - soon the extensive culinary delights of the renowned First Class Titanic Restaurant will be spread out for the delectation of your trembling palate.
1466 | 375 | 374 | What a delight to see you once again.
1467 | 393 | 392 | How may I be of assistance?
1468 | 377 | 376 | How can I help you?
1469 | 379 | 378 | It's pleasure unbridled to be here at your service again.
1470 | 381 | 380 | And how may I be of service on this joyously lovely day?
1471 | 383 | 382 | Yes Fentible's here, his only desire to serve.
1472 | 385 | 384 | Here I am your favorite DoorBot at your service.
1473 | 387 | 386 | DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1474 | 389 | 388 | DoorBot at your service.
1475 | 391 | 390 | Fentible, at your service.
1476 | 455 | 454 | To be honest I'm having doubts about my accuracy - ask the BellBot, he'll get it right.
1477 | 1383 | 1382 | Well my own philosophy's a simple one: think of life as just a word upon a balloon and you'll never lack a smile upon your face.
1478 | 77 | 76 | Not entirely with you there - we probably lost a little something in the old translation but let's not worry about that. Onwards and upwards!
1479 | 1001 | 1000 | Thank you for your suggestion. Just as soon as you're aboard we shall be dancing down the old moonbeams and what unconfined joy that will be.
1480 | 1009 | 1008 | There's no time to hang around, it's now or never.
1481 | 1017 | 1016 | That is the Personal Electronic Thing - one of the great miracles of the age which I can tell you're going to have a lot of fun using.
1482 | 1025 | 1024 | Ah yes, compared to the old Klepton lobe invader it is rather primitive but we do find it more reliable.
1483 | 1033 | 1032 | I can see you're excited and so you should be: it's a Personal Electronic Thing and it's your key to having a jolly lazy time while you're on board.
1484 | 1041 | 1040 | Ah well that's for me to know and for you to have fun finding out.
1485 | 1049 | 1048 | Look on the bright side. The property market's bottomed out in this region of the galaxy so it's a perfect time to buy another one.
1486 | 1057 | 1056 | Due to an unfortunate navigational error the cruise liner Starship Titanic appears to have crashed into your lovely home. Normal service will be resumed as soon as possible however and I expect limitless delight and joy to break out any second now.
1487 | 1375 | 1374 | What a charming notion. If as I surmise you are referring to Leovinus then I am sure we will meet him soon.
1488 | 85 | 84 | No-one's ever tried it at this speed - why not just settle back and enjoy the cruise?
1489 | 371 | 370 | Madam.
1490 | 1327 | 1326 | Well from my experience you'll be missing an absolute beano: nothing like a maiden voyage to invigorate the soul. And this is nothing like a maiden voyage. ho ho ho.
1491 | 373 | 372 | Other.
1492 | 97 | 96 | We've got the variety that doesn't converse but looking on the bright side that does mean we don't have to form a relationship with it.
1493 | 105 | 104 | Tempt the little fellow with a tasty morsel and he'll be out of there like a shot.
1494 | 113 | 112 | He'll be off that perch like a whiphound after a prawn dinner.
1495 | 129 | 128 | You're on the right track there - I'd try the restaurant.
1496 | 137 | 136 | All it wants is to be happy and now you're here I'm sure you're going to help.
1497 | 145 | 144 | I'm certain that if you feed it right it will be an absolute boon.
1498 | 161 | 160 | What a thoroughly, thoroughly wonderful idea.
1499 | 169 | 168 | Distract it with a spot of food, that's sure to work.
1500 | 177 | 176 | Find the address, pop the little fellow into the Succ-U-Bus and whizz it away.
1501 | 185 | 184 | Delightful creature isn't it. Been on board for some time now. Perhaps there's going to be a circus?
1502 | 1305 | 1304 | You'll have to send the parrot yourself, he'll be happy to oblige.
1503 | 1323 | 1322 | Chuck the little beggar through the Succ-U-Bus, you know it makes sense.
1504 | 777 | 776 | They'd make a lovely hat, very useful if winter sets in.
1505 | 121 | 120 | Most parrots will eat anything so it's worth taking a few risks with what you offer.
1506 | 153 | 152 | It knows a lot of what's been going on and I'm sure you'll get it to help.
1507 | 785 | 784 | Jumping jillerbys you're right! That's not a light, it's Titania's nose - no wonder we're having a rum time if there's bits of the boss all over the shop. At least we know what we're dealing with eh?
1508 | 793 | 792 | Pop it back on the old girl's face I think and everything will be tickety boo.
1509 | 801 | 800 | Looks rather important to me: I've a feeling it's going to come in handy during the journey.
1510 | 809 | 808 | In my experience the successful traveler is prepared for any eventuality: I'm sure you're a successful traveler.
1511 | 817 | 816 | I believe that's part of the parrot's perch. We live in strange times and I would say take it with you.
1512 | 825 | 824 | I do believe that is the sound of a parrot in pain. It'll be over in a tic just as soon as the parrot reaches the other end.
1513 | 833 | 832 | Just find him and chuck him back in the Succ-U-Bus - easy as pulling the wings off a Niblet.
1514 | 841 | 840 | The parrot went wherever you addressed it - I'm sure it's very happy there.
1515 | 849 | 848 | If I were you I'd leave the parrot here whilst you enjoy the ship's attractions.
1516 | 857 | 856 | Only watches rubbish but I'm hoping to introduce it to a little classic adaptation as the voyage continues.
1517 | 865 | 864 | Well I do believe the little fellow's trying to tell you something about Titania.
1518 | 193 | 192 | Now you're cooking - I do believe that our highly regarded Second Class Guests are furnished with an unlimited supply of pistachios upon embarkation.
1519 | 1297 | 1296 | He'll scoff the lot faster than a gold-plated Succ-U-Bus.
1520 | 201 | 200 | This is the wildest of wild guesses - but I do believe there's a bird sauce dispenser in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1521 | 1267 | 1266 | Heavens below, you've done it if my memory for purees doesn't deceive me.
1522 | 209 | 208 | There's bound to be a spare cup or a glass somewhere.
1523 | 217 | 216 | You can do anything. All you have to do is believe and if you believe that, you'll believe anything, and thus become omnipotent.
1524 | 1345 | 1344 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship, bright as a button and fresh as a daisy.
1525 | 329 | 328 | I'm sure D'Astragaar, our enormously talented Maitre d' will take your order shortly.
1526 | 361 | 360 | Looks to me like some sort of circuit connector. D'you know - I'd hang onto that if I were you, I think it could come in very handy.
1527 | 321 | 320 | I do believe there has been a catastrophe of fatal proportions. Still, I hear the soup's always good.
1528 | 345 | 344 | Ah well, as we all know death is a matter of opinion.
1529 | 353 | 352 | Well I know Mr. Leovinus popped up here to see him - perhaps he tripped and fell against him?
1530 | 337 | 336 | That I'm afraid to say is Mr. Scraliontis, the Starship Titanic Accountant.
1531 | 225 | 224 | Jolly good idea. I'll get right onto it.
1532 | 233 | 232 | Oh yes the multi-bot multi-user license opened up a whole new world to me - used to be stuck in the one room for ever you see. But now - I'm a whole new Bot. Or a lot of Bots I suppose you could say.
1533 | 873 | 872 | Ah yes the great Doreen McLevity - the finest female impersonator ever to pull on a rubber hat.
1534 | 883 | 882 | If you make her smile we will all be a smorbit happier and that's reward in itself.
1535 | 891 | 890 | As long as the PET code matches the room code you're home and dry - and what a charmingly... miniature room it is.
1536 | 899 | 898 | Exactly one hundred and four smorbits by one hundred and eight. It's a beauty isn't it.
1537 | 1361 | 1360 | Dead I believe, but I'm sure it's not as serious as it looks.
1538 | 369 | 368 | Sir.
1539 | 907 | 906 | A variety of sweetmeats and savories for your joy and delectation.
1540 | 915 | 914 | Lovely.
1541 | 935 | 934 | Live a little. Eat them all up. Feast yourself on these Titanic Tasties.
1542 | 241 | 240 | That is the Succ-U-Bus, an expert in the field of whizzing things round the ship to wherever you want them to go.
1543 | 249 | 248 | It will whizz off to wherever you want it to go faster than you can say intergalactic upgrade, and certainly faster than you could get one.
1544 | 257 | 256 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship, bright as a button and fresh as a daisy.
1545 | 1283 | 1282 | Doesn't look as though I'm designed for taking, does it. I'm sure you'll find someone to help.
1546 | 265 | 264 | Any minute now I expect the captain will be squirting the old quasars, bringing the nose round and locking-on to paradise...
1547 | 273 | 272 | There has been and there can be no other vessel bearing the name Titanic: the word Titanic is wholly owned by the Pithy family of Zinnerman B and may only be uttered out of context under license. Certain in our uniqueness, we fly proudly through the universe bursting the parameters of known luxury, a star in the firmament of service...
1548 | 281 | 280 | Short of winning a competition I'd suggest catching the DeskBot on a good day and using your abundant charm.
1549 | 289 | 288 | Upgrades are always available for the more sophisticated traveler and I do believe you'll find the DeskBot most accommodating.
1550 | 961 | 960 | All off-limits I'm afraid to Super Galactic Traveler class. But don't you worry, I'm sure you'll pick up an upgrade soon.
1551 | 969 | 968 | Quite simple. Just take an elevator, tell the helpful LiftBot the floor you require, and the world is your sea-pig.
1552 | 977 | 976 | The elevators go down to the staterooms and although you are only in Super Galactic Traveler class I think you're going to be rather impressed with your own cabin.
1553 | 993 | 992 | Joy of joys, Titania is our great mother intelligence.
1554 | 985 | 984 | That is the exquisite Titania - the central intelligence of the ship.
1555 | 1369 | 1368 | I think we'd better just leave him here. Who knows - he might feel better after a bit of peace and quiet.
1556 | 297 | 296 | Just take a stroll and ask a BellBot - he's the expert or so he tells us.
1557 | 305 | 304 | I think you should go exploring - the old Titanic's full of surprises for the discerning guest.
1558 | 313 | 312 | DoorBot 5987889317493763392 at your service but not for long I believe: I shall be running the ship shortly and within days expect to be invited onto the board of the company.
1559 | 487 | 486 | Tremendous asset to the ship's company - finest Maitre d'Bot ever to run a restaurant.
1560 | 479 | 478 | Wonderful fellow. Most entertaining, charming BarBot in the whole fleet.
1561 | 1353 | 1352 | That's the accountant. But don't you worry, I'm sure he's just playing about.
1562 | 471 | 470 | Charming chap. A trifle louche but terribly helpful, fine BellBot.
1563 | 463 | 462 | Charming woman. Delightful. Best DeskBot in the fleet.
1564 | 1337 | 1336 | I've never seen it do that before. I'm sure someone will rectify the Succ-U-Bus immediately.
1565 | 95 | 94 | The memory's shot to pieces and it's not getting any better. I'll forget my head soon if it's not screwed on.
1566 | 1405 | 1404 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1567 | 1397 | 1396 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1568 | 1413 | 1412 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1569 | 7 | 6 | New one on me. Doesn't sound too pleasant you know.
1570 | 15 | 14 | I've not seen any yet. Knowing my luck I'll have to wring some necks before this voyage is out.
1571 | 1261 | 1260 | There isn't a bomb on board. And if there was I wouldn't remember it anyway.
1572 | 1295 | 1294 | Moving bowls. This doesn't sound good. If the bowls are moving - then we can't trust anything.
1573 | 23 | 22 | Haven't got a clue what that is. I'm sure it's deeply important and my forgetting will land us in some awful predicament.
1574 | 31 | 30 | Chickens - they're the fluffy ones with legs aren't they. No chance. They'll be rock solid in the freezers - lucky beggars.
1575 | 39 | 38 | Are there chickens in here? They'll be messy and I shall probably have to tidy up.
1576 | 47 | 46 | Who knows. To be honest I'm more worried about my memory. Did you say something?
1577 | 55 | 54 | Who knows? We're probably stuck with them. Just my luck - racing chickens.
1578 | 63 | 62 | Chicken? What chicken? They'll be letting starlings on board next.
1579 | 711 | 710 | It's not a job for a grown bot but it's probably the best I'm going to get.
1580 | 719 | 718 | I can't remember what these buttons do. And anyway, it's unlikely they're going to make me feel happier.
1581 | 727 | 726 | Don't know. Perhaps this is all I do. Perhaps I'm a failure.
1582 | 735 | 734 | Oh yes very nice. I always wondered what planets looked like close up.
1583 | 743 | 742 | To our doom I expect. I can't remember if I've been there before but it sounds to me like a place you only visit once.
1584 | 751 | 750 | Knowing our luck if you press that button we shall all be blown to smithereens.
1585 | 759 | 758 | Whatever it is, getting involved with it's going to make you about as happy as a Bogon prawn on a barbecue.
1586 | 767 | 766 | Who knows what they are. It's probably where they keep the rubbish bins.
1587 | 775 | 774 | Whatever it is I can promise you it leads to neither wealth, fame or happiness.
1588 | 75 | 74 | Don't know. Don't think I eat. So I don't think I know about food.
1589 | 1265 | 1264 | Might as well ask a Luthian bookie for an honest game of cards.
1590 | 435 | 434 | Well here I am. Do your worst. Whoever you are.
1591 | 437 | 436 | Have we met? Whatever. Better tell me what useless service you wish me to perform.
1592 | 439 | 438 | Unknown guest. I'll do what you want but it's not going to help.
1593 | 441 | 440 | I don't believe we've met. How may I be of service on this deeply depressing day?
1594 | 443 | 442 | Greetings stranger. What ridiculously pointless task would you like me to perform?
1595 | 445 | 444 | Welcome to the Starship Floating Coffin. DoorBot at your service, not that it'll do any good.
1596 | 447 | 446 | Hello - whoever you are. DoorBot here, ready for anything.
1597 | 449 | 448 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot at your service - who knows for how long.
1598 | 451 | 450 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here. Not that I can help much.
1599 | 461 | 460 | Haven't got a clue. You don't want to go there anyway I'm sure.
1600 | 453 | 452 | Can't remember. But I'm pretty certain we're all doomed.
1601 | 1389 | 1388 | Don't ask me. Even if I did know I'd be the last to know so that wouldn't be any use.
1602 | 83 | 82 | No... you've lost me there. Not much chance of finding the old thread either, the way my memory's... what was I saying?... No. Gone again.
1603 | 1007 | 1006 | The past is a forgotten country. And I can't remember how to get there.
1604 | 1015 | 1014 | There's no time to hang around. Unless we get aboard now something dreadful will happen. It always does.
1605 | 1023 | 1022 | I presume it's something rather important that's fallen out of my brain. Won't make me think any better though will it.
1606 | 1031 | 1030 | Take my word for it, it's a trial for me too and there's nothing we can do about it.
1607 | 1039 | 1038 | Never seen it before but if it came off our ship it's probably a piece of old junk.
1608 | 1047 | 1046 | Who knows. Perhaps we keep a file on the ugliest passengers.
1609 | 1055 | 1054 | Is it, is it oh well I suppose it'll be me who's getting the blame.
1610 | 1063 | 1062 | Something rather unnecessary appears to have happened although bless me I have little recollection of the event. Such is my experience of these matters that I expect the mantle of blame will be placed upon my shoulders.
1611 | 1381 | 1380 | Don't remember who our leader is. Even if I did they wouldn't be bothered meeting you. Leaders never are. Or is that fish I'm thinking of?
1612 | 91 | 90 | Haven't got a clue. Still you didn't have much of a life anyway from what I've seen.
1613 | 1333 | 1332 | Well it's your choice. If you don't come your life will just continue in its sad and desolate form for the rest of infinity but you won't listen to me will you?
1614 | 103 | 102 | I didn't know parrots could talk. Typical - we got the one that just spouts rubbish.
1615 | 111 | 110 | I seem to remember playing a tune helps. No, that's snakes. I'm no help, am I.
1616 | 119 | 118 | We had a parrot once. Or was it a fish. Anyway, it died.
1617 | 135 | 134 | Do you know, I'd bet all I own there's no parrot food on this ship. I wonder what I do own.
1618 | 143 | 142 | Who knows. I expect we shall have to watch it eat for the rest of the trip.
1619 | 151 | 150 | Who knows. Frankly the day I have to rely upon a parrot is the day I'll have my brain removed.
1620 | 167 | 166 | I'm sure there's a way but I've forgotten it. I don't think you'd catch it anyway.
1621 | 175 | 174 | What parrot? Good lord they'll let anyone aboard these days.
1622 | 183 | 182 | Memory's gone you know. Not coming back. End of DoorBot as far as I can see.
1623 | 191 | 190 | Oh. A parrot. I expect it's an early warning system for loss of atmosphere.
1624 | 1303 | 1302 | Parrots. Pistachios. You know I had the distinct feeling I was working on a Starship. Perhaps though, I work in a zoo and this is all a dream.
1625 | 1321 | 1320 | If there is a parrot on board he's not going to listen to me.
1626 | 783 | 782 | I wonder where they came from. Not that they'll help. We're suffering from an intelligence failure big enough to fill a blue hole and they send us feathers. Typical.
1627 | 127 | 126 | You've got me there. I wouldn't offer it anything because I don't think it's deserved it.
1628 | 159 | 158 | Never seen it before and I doubt some old bird's going to be much help.
1629 | 791 | 790 | Looks like a nose doesn't it. Parrots, noses, bodies, I'm afraid it's not going to be the journey of a million lifetimes that I promised you.
1630 | 799 | 798 | Who knows. We could put string through it and wear it as a necklace I suppose.
1631 | 807 | 806 | Doesn't look much like a perch does it? Probably the Crank Laser from the engine. In which case who cares because we're all doomed.
1632 | 815 | 814 | I don't know what it is but it looks pretty useless to me.
1633 | 823 | 822 | Couldn't tell you what it is. You'll just be wasting your time lugging it round the ship.
1634 | 831 | 830 | Sounds awfully like a Rapulon to me. Could be a Monkey-eating Plenge. Or is it a Titherer. Whatever: as soon as it gets out it'll probably eat us.
1635 | 839 | 838 | So we had a parrot did we. Won't see that again I bet.
1636 | 847 | 846 | Who knows? Could be freezing it's feathers off in deep space for all we know.
1637 | 855 | 854 | Don't ask me. Since when was a parrot the solution to anybody's problems?
1638 | 863 | 862 | Don't recognize any of it. If it was something I liked I probably wouldn't remember anyway so it's not worth watching.
1639 | 871 | 870 | Haven't got a clue but if you ask me it's just trying to confuse you.
1640 | 199 | 198 | Whatever they are, it's unlikely we'll find any before the Titanic veers off the old Ocean Highway and takes us to our doom.
1641 | 207 | 206 | Could be anywhere. Knowing my luck it'll come out of my head and ruin this jacket.
1642 | 215 | 214 | Heard the one about the amnesiac DoorBot who couldn't remember his... Sorry I seem to have forgotten the um - you know, the line that goes at the end of a watjamacallit.
1643 | 223 | 222 | So there's a bar is there. Ah well I suppose it's full of riff-raff drinking big bollas and singing star shanties.
1644 | 1351 | 1350 | It's anyone's guess. I expect it 's a deeply unpleasant experience involving hitherto unknown forms of pain and suffering.
1645 | 335 | 334 | Can't say I know who the chappie on the floor is but I don't think you'll get much to eat here.
1646 | 367 | 366 | Some useless piece of rubbish I expect. I'd chuck it away if I were you.
1647 | 327 | 326 | Do you know I can't remember if it's always like this. But from the look of things, I bet the soup's off.
1648 | 351 | 350 | Whatever he is I've got an awful feeling it's going to happen to us all one day.
1649 | 359 | 358 | Who knows? It's all going to end in tears so what does it matter.
1650 | 343 | 342 | Don't know who it is but I doubt he's going to pay the bill.
1651 | 231 | 230 | Yes of course. I wonder what I did to annoy you?
1652 | 239 | 238 | Another DoorBot eh? So what bad news can he tell me I don't already know. but have probably forgotten.
1653 | 879 | 878 | Could be anyone. Looks too pretty to have been a friend of mine.
1654 | 889 | 888 | Make her smile again. Make her smile again. I think it's what they call quality time.
1655 | 897 | 896 | Who knows? I wouldn't give this room to my dog. If I had one. Maybe I do. Or did. I've certainly not fed it for days. Probably run off now. If I ever did have one. You can't trust them can you. Even to belong to you.
1656 | 905 | 904 | Mentally I have nothing to compare it with but I do suspect you'll become unhappy or even depressed if you stay long in here.
1657 | 1367 | 1366 | There's a word for his condition, but it momentarily escapes me.
1658 | 913 | 912 | Just trifles I expect. Nothing remotely exciting. But since my memory's gone what's the point of exciting anyway. Can't remember exciting so why bother.
1659 | 921 | 920 | Who knows? We're eating sweets and we're doomed.
1660 | 941 | 940 | Eat what?
1661 | 247 | 246 | Ugly beggar isn't it. Couldn't tell you what it is. Probably earns more than I do.
1662 | 255 | 254 | Haven't got a clue. But I wouldn't count on seeing it again.
1663 | 263 | 262 | It's anyone's guess. I expect it 's a deeply unpleasant experience involving hitherto unknown forms of pain and suffering.
1664 | 1287 | 1286 | I would take it but I don't think I know where to go. Not even sure I can go. Stuck really aren't I.
1665 | 271 | 270 | You're joking I presume, we're stuck fast on this hovel you call a planet. I could be wrong though it has been known to happen... I think.
1666 | 279 | 278 | Titanic. Titanic. No, I'm afraid the word means nothing to me. Still, what do I know. Not very much to be honest. I suppose that's why I'm here with you. It's sunk to this.
1667 | 287 | 286 | Whatever it is I'm sure you don't need it and you probably wouldn't get one anyway. So I wouldn't bother.
1668 | 295 | 294 | We're all unhappy and we all know it's going to get worse.
1669 | 967 | 966 | Who knows, who cares, who lives, who dies... Every door that opens offers yet another twist of fate.
1670 | 975 | 974 | Why not just fall off - finish the whole thing while you're ahead. I'm forgetting. You're probably not allowed to.
1671 | 983 | 982 | The elevators appear to go down. I don't know where they end up but down doesn't sound to me like a promising direction.
1672 | 999 | 998 | Never heard of her. Probably just a ship's follower, given what some of this crew are like.
1673 | 991 | 990 | No idea. A very large stow-away I expect.
1674 | 1277 | 1276 | It's a lottery. Or is it? I think I'll go and lie down. I'm not happy.
1675 | 303 | 302 | Never heard of it. I'm sure if it exists it will be eminently forgettable.
1676 | 311 | 310 | Who knows? Who cares?
1677 | 319 | 318 | No. It's gone. Had it for a second. Lost it . Not much chance I'll ever remember now.
1678 | 493 | 492 | Never heard of him. Sounds suspiciously Galloid to me.
1679 | 485 | 484 | Never heard of him. Sounds awfully Blarghish to me.
1680 | 1359 | 1358 | Haven't got a clue but I'll tell you something - whatever's happened to him I'll probably take the blame for it.
1681 | 477 | 476 | Never heard of him. Sounds awful whoever he is.
1682 | 469 | 468 | Never heard of her. Doubtless she'll contribute to this mess whoever she is.
1683 | 1343 | 1342 | I wonder if it always does that. It's probably suffered a complete mental breakdown. I won't be far behind it at this rate.
1684 | 1403 | 1402 | I think you'd better ask the BarBot about that.
1685 | 1395 | 1394 | I think you'd better ask the BellBot about that.
1686 | 1411 | 1410 | I think you'd better ask the DeskBot about that.
1687 | 5 | 4 | It's a foul-tasting witches' brew which when smothered over food utterly ruins it.
1688 | 13 | 12 | Yes I noticed when we left port. They breed like gibbets you know - it's going to get very messy.
1689 | 1259 | 1258 | Things are bad, but not that bad. There's no bomb on board.
1690 | 1293 | 1292 | It's probably turbulence - just my luck if we're in for a spot of stormy weather.
1691 | 21 | 20 | Each room has a unique identifier. We shall probably get them all confused and end up lost in space.
1692 | 29 | 28 | The restaurants are stuffed with chickens but I doubt you'll find anyone to serve you.
1693 | 37 | 36 | You'll need to change the chicken speed...
1694 | 45 | 44 | You'll need something to wipe the chicken. Sadly until you have the nous to get yourself upgraded you will find a suitable artifact hard to come by.
1695 | 53 | 52 | Pop up to Titania's Chamber. On second thoughts, given your track record I doubt you'll manage it.
1696 | 61 | 60 | Send it to the Parrot Room. We'll be lucky if it does any good though.
1697 | 709 | 708 | This is but one of my diverse responsibilities and the way things are going it will probably be my last.
1698 | 717 | 716 | I don't care where we go or what we do. All I know is that life isn't what it used to be.
1699 | 725 | 724 | The only time you'll find me down here is when there's a problem like you to deal with.
1700 | 733 | 732 | Very beautiful. Until you remember we should be a million light years from here.
1701 | 741 | 740 | We're going to check you in at which point I shall be at your beck and call for ever.
1702 | 749 | 748 | Press that button and I suspect our dismal journey recommences.
1703 | 757 | 756 | That is the DeskBot. Prepare to feel well gloomed.
1704 | 765 | 764 | You won't be needing the embarkation doors till we land. That is if we don't crash first.
1705 | 773 | 772 | Tradesman's entrance and yours truly has the dubious honor of using it daily.
1706 | 73 | 72 | There's chicken, chicken and chicken and I'm afraid that's considered choice enough for most.
1707 | 415 | 414 | Sir, Madam or other. What wearisome task can I perform for you now?
1708 | 433 | 432 | Sir, Madam or other. You called. I came. To be honest, I don't have much choice.
1709 | 417 | 416 | Sir, Madam or other. Here I am again. Why do I bother?
1710 | 419 | 418 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here, ready for another fool's errand.
1711 | 421 | 420 | Sir, Madam or other. Fentible here. The reluctant DoorBot.
1712 | 423 | 422 | Sir, Madam or other. Your wish is my command. Unfortunately.
1713 | 425 | 424 | Sir, Madam or other. I'll do what you want but it's not going to change anything.
1714 | 427 | 426 | Sir, Madam or other. I don't know why I bother turning up - things aren't going to get better.
1715 | 429 | 428 | Sir, Madam or other. Yes, hello. Another day another meaningless task.
1716 | 431 | 430 | Sir, Madam or other. DoorBot here - programmed to help, for what it's worth.
1717 | 459 | 458 | I wouldn't trust myself to answer I'm afraid. You could try the BellBot - if it's worth it.
1718 | 1387 | 1386 | This isn't a game: we're flying headlong to disaster or my name's not Fentible.
1719 | 81 | 80 | Not entirely with you there - we probably lost a little something in the old translation. Reminds me of the day we had that explosion in the language bottling plant. Never did clear up the mess. Split infinitives everywhere.
1720 | 1005 | 1004 | If only we could go back. How often we try and find only unhappiness.
1721 | 1013 | 1012 | No time to hang around. Unless we get aboard now we'll be doomed to unhappiness for the rest of our lives.
1722 | 1021 | 1020 | That is the Personal Electronic Thing. Yet another useless gizmo.
1723 | 1029 | 1028 | Compared to the old Klepton lobe invader it is rather primitive. It's probably damaging your health even as we speak. Probably damaged mine already.
1724 | 1037 | 1036 | It's a Personal Electronic Thing. Won't work of course so I wouldn't bother getting excited.
1725 | 1045 | 1044 | Ship's rules. So they know where to send the body I suppose.
1726 | 1053 | 1052 | Yes, what a mess. We so nearly missed you too.
1727 | 1061 | 1060 | Due to an unfortunate navigational error the cruise liner Starship Titanic appears to have crashed into your lovely home. Such is my experience of these matters that I expect the mantle of blame will be placed upon my shoulders.
1728 | 1379 | 1378 | You've hit the gizzup on the head there. The whole ship's leaderless, rudderless, and out of control.
1729 | 89 | 88 | No hope whatsoever. By now they'll have set the starlings going.
1730 | 1335 | 1334 | It's your choice. Stay or go it will end in disaster. It always does. I think.
1731 | 101 | 100 | These parrots can't answer questions, which is a shame because it could probably get us out of this mess.
1732 | 109 | 108 | He only leaves that cage when he chooses. I recommend giving up all hope now.
1733 | 117 | 116 | Chicken and pistachios is all he's been calling for. He'll probably change his mind.
1734 | 133 | 132 | Chickens and nuts is what he wants. You'll have no joy finding them - not with the ship in this state.
1735 | 141 | 140 | The foul creature is continually hungry and the task of feeding it appears to have fallen to me.
1736 | 149 | 148 | I'll try but I think it's talking complete nonsense.
1737 | 165 | 164 | I feel the same way myself, never succeeded though.
1738 | 173 | 172 | He's a stubborn bird. And sadly I doubt you have the capacity to outwit it.
1739 | 181 | 180 | Throw the little beggar into the Succ-U-Bus and send it off. Good luck - he'll probably just fly back again straight away.
1740 | 189 | 188 | It's been on board since the ship was under construction. Funny thing really, everything was alright until the parrot arrived.
1741 | 1309 | 1308 | Getting the parrot to do something you want is about as easy as getting a new wig on Talapandee.
1742 | 1311 | 1310 | Getting the parrot to do something you want is about as easy as swallowing your own foot.
1743 | 781 | 780 | I think the parrot needs the feathers more than you. Although what use is the parrot. All it does is drive me mad.
1744 | 125 | 124 | Most parrots will eat anything but this one's a mangy beggar so I'd start with wood and only offer it the roast Zenuvian partridge when you think it's really earned it.
1745 | 157 | 156 | It knows a lot of what's been going on but as it's a parrot I doubt you'll learn very much.
1746 | 789 | 788 | That's Titania's nose. No wonder we're in a mess. It's chaos. That's what it is - chaos.
1747 | 797 | 796 | Try and get it back on Titania's face, although I doubt that this is going to be the end of our troubles.
1748 | 805 | 804 | Looks rather important to me. However, if the parrot's had it it's probably useless by now.
1749 | 813 | 812 | In my experience the successful traveler is prepared for any eventuality: although quite how an old parrot's perch will help you defeats me.
1750 | 821 | 820 | I believe that's part of the parrot's perch. I can think of no earthly reason why you should want to carry it round the ship.
1751 | 829 | 828 | I do believe that is the sound of a parrot in pain. Just our luck if he's stuck - he'll scream like that till the universe freezes over.
1752 | 837 | 836 | Just hang around - he's not a creature that likes to stay out late.
1753 | 845 | 844 | The parrot went wherever you addressed it - in theory.
1754 | 853 | 852 | The state we're in you might as well wring its neck and wear it as a hat for all the good it will do.
1755 | 861 | 860 | Just the usual rubbish but what can you expect?
1756 | 869 | 868 | It's just trying to confuse you with references to Titania.
1757 | 197 | 196 | They have pistachios in Second Class but I doubt whether you qualify for an upgrade.
1758 | 1301 | 1300 | He'll eat it all right. Then he'll want more. And then he'll just sulk and moan and generally ruin our lives.
1759 | 205 | 204 | Try the riff-raff restaurant. Do you know I have a dreadful feeling I shall have to do all your thinking for you.
1760 | 213 | 212 | I seem to remember seeing a spare glass somewhere in the bar - is it worth all the effort I ask myself.
1761 | 221 | 220 | I believe you can but quite what you're going to do with it once it's there is beyond me.
1762 | 1349 | 1348 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship. Minus my dignity and what little pride remains.
1763 | 333 | 332 | Given the state of D'Astragaar there I don't think you're going to be getting much to eat.
1764 | 365 | 364 | It's a circuit connector I believe. But you don't stand a chance of finding where it comes from.
1765 | 325 | 324 | There's been murder committed all right. Given the state of the ship I doubt we'll catch the culprits.
1766 | 349 | 348 | Dead and there's not many comeback from there for breakfast I can tell you.
1767 | 357 | 356 | I've an awful feeling that dear Mr. Leovinus may have got a teeny bit worked up and done something he shouldn't have.
1768 | 341 | 340 | That's Scraliontis the Starship Titanic Project Accountant. Obviously didn't leave a big enough tip.
1769 | 229 | 228 | As you wish. I knew I'd be treated like this.
1770 | 237 | 236 | Oh yes there's no getting away from me is there. And there's no getting away from you either.
1771 | 877 | 876 | That'll be Doreen McLevity. Rather a low-life sort of person - not the subject of polite conversation.
1772 | 887 | 886 | Nothing happens. It's just a picture to amuse yourself with. Part of the entertainment structure for riff-raff class. On. Off. Smile. No smile. Sad isn't it.
1773 | 895 | 894 | As long as the PET code matches the room code you're home and dry - I don't think you'll be throwing many parties though.
1774 | 903 | 902 | Not exactly the Grand Palace of Hambra Gan I agree but what can you expect if you don't check the brochure beforehand.
1775 | 1365 | 1364 | Dead, and there's not many come back from there I can tell you.
1776 | 911 | 910 | More little luxuries. Curiously they only serve to remind me of the fragility of life and the danger of imminent hyper disaster which we should now be confronting.
1777 | 919 | 918 | Why should I care?
1778 | 939 | 938 | Dance around the room with them on your head I doubt it will do much good.
1779 | 245 | 244 | Oh that's the Succ-U-Bus. A hopeless and deeply unpleasant piece of equipment which is as likely to function properly as the people of Tolluck are to renounce lip-salve..
1780 | 253 | 252 | Usually the Succ-U-Bus is supposed to whizz your object wherever you want it to go. Today your guess will be as good as mine.
1781 | 261 | 260 | I expect I'd pop out somewhere else in the ship. Minus my dignity and what little pride remains.
1782 | 1285 | 1284 | Don't do taking, they wouldn't load me with the know-how. Said I wasn't suitable. Shame really. I think I would have been quite good at taking.
1783 | 269 | 268 | We've lost our slot now so even if we do go we'll just end up in a stack over Langua Centauri.
1784 | 277 | 276 | There has been and there can be no other vessel bearing the name Titanic: the word Titanic is wholly owned by the Pithy family of Zinnerman B and may only be uttered out of context under license. I wonder if we paid for the license. Probably not.
1785 | 285 | 284 | The only way I know is to catch the DeskBot in a good mood and that's about as likely as getting a drink out of a Scrimpoid.
1786 | 293 | 292 | Upgrades are possible, but I don't think you're suitable material.
1787 | 965 | 964 | All off-limits I'm afraid to Super Galactic Traveler class. And with the DeskBot in her current mood there's little chance of an upgrade.
1788 | 973 | 972 | Just take an elevator. Of course you'll have to endure the LiftBot but what is life if not a trial.
1789 | 981 | 980 | The elevators go down to the staterooms. Hardly worth showing you to your room though, what with this air of doom lingering over the whole ship like astral fog at a gloom party.
1790 | 997 | 996 | Titania was our great all-embracing mother intelligence. I say "was" because she no longer appears to be functioning.
1791 | 989 | 988 | That is Titania. Supposedly the central intelligence of the ship. These days she's doing the job about as effectively as a lemon on a nib boot.
1792 | 1373 | 1372 | Don't think it matters what we do with him. I expect it will turn out to be my fault anyway.
1793 | 301 | 300 | Just ask a BellBot - but you'll probably find some reason why you can't go there.
1794 | 309 | 308 | Given the time it's taking to solve our problems I doubt it matters where you go.
1795 | 317 | 316 | DoorBot 5987889317493763392 at your pleasure. Just a number and doomed I'm sure to remain one.
1796 | 491 | 490 | Temperamental over-paid jumped up waiter if you ask me. Works up in the first class restaurant. Goes to pieces at the first hint of trouble.
1797 | 483 | 482 | Rudest BarBot in the whole fleet - the very last sort of chap you need in a crisis.
1798 | 1357 | 1356 | That's the accountant. And no-one's going to tell me he died a natural death.
1799 | 475 | 474 | Tiresome fellow, lazy, rude, forgetful. Altogether a bit of a slacker and not the kind of BellBot that's going to help when the chips are down.
1800 | 467 | 466 | Nasty piece of work Marsinta. The mother of all DeskBots.
1801 | 1341 | 1340 | I've never seen it do that before. I suppose that means they're broken all over the ship.
1802 | 527 | 526 | Ah, the theater! The smell of the crowd, the taste of the greasepaint, the sound of the sea-urchins burbling down in the pit.
1803 | 529 | 528 | Oh yes - actresses. Of course in my day Doreen McLevity was the toast of all the Bots.
1804 | 531 | 530 | Oh you mean Idiot Purchase Prompts.
1805 | 585 | 584 | Ah a creative spirit is amongst us. I must show you some of my poetry. On second thoughts perhaps I'll just tidy up one or two rough edges first...
1806 | 623 | 622 | You know, you ought to visit the Sculpture Chamber - I think you're somebody who'd really appreciate it.
1807 | 1263 | 1262 | At the risk of repeating myself...
1808 | 549 | 548 | Afraid they've not crossed the threshold into galactic branding yet, have they.
1809 | 551 | 550 | Well what do I know - I can only just keep up with the shops in Blerontin.
1810 | 553 | 552 | I'm so out of touch you know. Modern life is so overwhelming.
1811 | 545 | 544 | I'm awfully flattered but I have to warn you I'm programmed to go into citizen's arrest mode should anyone try and interfere with me.
1812 | 547 | 546 | You had to be there, I'm sure.
1813 | 557 | 556 | Sadly these days food is something I can only talk about.
1814 | 559 | 558 | Good lord that means you still have crime - how delicious, how exciting.
1815 | 565 | 564 | Well, talking of crime there've been some pretty rum goings on in the old Titanic you know. You couldn't have come at a better time.
1816 | 567 | 566 | I'm sure the name should mean something to me but I am a little out of touch.
1817 | 1065 | 1064 | Nobody likes a smartass.
1818 | 1067 | 1066 | I do believe we've got our universes mixed up haven't we?
1819 | 1069 | 1068 | Very droll very droll. Let's think about the Starship Titanic instead though shall we?
1820 | 1071 | 1070 | Very clever, very clever. But in the end - unimpressive.
1821 | 1073 | 1072 | Fascinating. Astonishing. And yet meaningless.
1822 | 1075 | 1074 | I don't know what you're talking about. That's the official line and I'm sticking to it.
1823 | 1077 | 1076 | I know exactly what you mean. But let us not dwell on the past.
1824 | 1079 | 1078 | Interesting reference. Thought I wouldn't spot it didn't you? Well - Ha! - that's what I say to you.
1825 | 1081 | 1080 | You're testing me aren't you?
1826 | 1085 | 1084 | Good because I'm getting bored ransacking my memory board just to keep up with your cleverness...
1827 | 1083 | 1082 | Well I passed. Shall we get on with our lives now?
1828 | 569 | 568 | Talking of drinks, you really ought to visit the bar you know while you're here. Fortillian, our barman, mixes a devastating cocktail.
1829 | 571 | 570 | Not my cup of tea I'm afraid. Perhaps you should talk to Krage, the BellBot.
1830 | 555 | 554 | Your humble earth settlements mean nothing to me I'm afraid.
1831 | 575 | 574 | Interesting. You know before I got scanned I used to have a lot of those. It's all been narrowed down a bit recently.
1832 | 573 | 572 | Ah what is fame but an empty bubble, what is gold but a transient shining trouble...
1833 | 561 | 560 | Really? Well as you can see, I'm rather state of the art myself.
1834 | 533 | 532 | If you're an animal lover you'll really appreciate the menu in the first class restaurant. It's full of animals. They are dead of course, but that's just a technicality really.
1835 | 579 | 578 | Ah the bright lights, the lemony screen, what might have been...
1836 | 619 | 618 | Now if you're interested in wild life you mustn't leave the ship without visiting the Arboretum.
1837 | 577 | 576 | Talking of food, if you get yourself upgraded you'll be able to sample the extraordinary delights of the First Class Restaurant.
1838 | 581 | 580 | I used to play computer games you know, but they take up so much time don't they?
1839 | 589 | 588 | I know what you mean - bits of paper with writing on them. How delightfully primitive.
1840 | 605 | 604 | You know if you're interested in that sort of thing you ought to talk to the LiftBot. Nobby's his name, bit of an old soldier.
1841 | 593 | 592 | Now let me give you a little hint about chaps like that: round them up and put them somewhere safe for a year or two. You'll find you never really needed them at all.
1842 | 587 | 586 | You know I was always a great fan of Doreen McLevity but you probably wouldn't know of her.
1843 | 583 | 582 | Oh dear. Goes right over my head that sort of thing. Normally we'd have a PhilosoBot you could talk to but we seem to be rather undermanned.
1844 | 591 | 590 | Never heard of it I'm afraid but I'm new to this sector of the galaxy...
1845 | 599 | 598 | Science fiction. What a charmingly naive planet you do come from.
1846 | 601 | 600 | Such a sticky pastime - it astonishes me that so many species think so highly of it.
1847 | 603 | 602 | We picked up some of your soaps on our way through your atmosphere. Quite - how can I put it - enervating.
1848 | 607 | 606 | Tell you what, why not pop up to the music room later and play it for me.
1849 | 609 | 608 | How extraordinary to think that a primitive species such as your own could have embarked upon the great dark frontiers. How awfully clever of you.
1850 | 611 | 610 | I've said it once and I'll say it again - there's only one sport and that's Nib!
1851 | 613 | 612 | Whatever passes for sport on earth - put em up against a nib player and they'd be dead within seconds.
1852 | 615 | 614 | One mustn't mock of course, they're jolly useful chaps to have around.
1853 | 617 | 616 | Please treat your DoorBot courteously at all times: rude words can often offend.
1854 | 1313 | 1312 | Talapandee is a delightful holiday resort in the sensitively expanded Sunny region of Galantheon. Visitors to Talapandee may be assured of a charming and restful vacation all the year round. Unless they wear a wig. Holidaymakers wearing wigs in Talapandee are liable to be rounded up by the syrup squad, put up against a wall and summarily shot.
1855 | 595 | 594 | I've never been a great one for toys but I'm sure you'll enjoy the challenge of the chicken trap in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1856 | 535 | 534 | How charming - you still have three dimensional transport.
1857 | 537 | 536 | How charming - you still have two dimensional transport.
1858 | 539 | 538 | Ah the golden age of travel - you invented the wheel so recently you must still really enjoy it.
1859 | 541 | 540 | I suppose at the speeds you normally travel you can see things out of the window.
1860 | 597 | 596 | TV presenters - what strange, sad folk they are. Of course they're extinct on so many planets now. Just weren't able to adapt.
1861 | 543 | 542 | You'll find that television is just a phase that all planets go through.
1862 | 621 | 620 | Ah well, if it's a blunt instrument you're after I can heartily recommend the chicken in the Super Galactic Traveler Restaurant.
1863 | 563 | 562 | How charming. You have your own little computer systems on earth do you. That must keep you awfully amused.
1864 | 1317 | 1316 | I can't tell you.
1865 | 1319 | 1318 | Because of the reason.
1866 | 1315 | 1314 | Because of the reason.
1867 | 881 | 880 | Yes I'm sure. Let's just change the subject shall we or better still why not go and look at another room.
1868 | 945 | 944 | I don't think that's going to help.
1869 | 949 | 948 | Sorry, can't remember.
1870 | 947 | 946 | Because of the reason.
1871 | 943 | 942 | Why on earth would you want to do that?
1872 | 955 | 954 | Who are you?
1873 | 957 | 956 | Where am I?
1874 | 959 | 958 | I'm no better so you'll just have to put up with me.
1875 | 1197 | 1196 | Don't suppose you know who I am do you. Ah well, I'm sure it'll come to me.
1876 | 1199 | 1198 | Sorry, can't help you. Total memory failure - give me a day or two, sure to come back.
1877 | 1177 | 1176 | Leave that one with me for a week or two would you?
1878 | 1201 | 1200 | Who am I? That's more important. Still, I'm sure someone will come along soon to collect me.
1879 | 1175 | 1174 | Oh dear another of those penetrating questions. I'm sure if you wait the answer will come to me. Umm..... ummmmmm no apparently not.
1880 | 1193 | 1192 | Who's flying the ship? Who did away with Brobostigon? Go for the big questions.
1881 | 1195 | 1194 | Who's been fiddling with the ship's controls? That's what I want to know.
1882 | 1169 | 1168 | What's that parrot on about? You know, he's more than the dumb creature I first took him for.
1883 | 1171 | 1170 | What can we do to get Fortillian out of his blessed loop? I'm sure you'll think of something.
1884 | 1173 | 1172 | What about chicken for dinner. I'm told the SGT restaurant has a quite singular menu.
1885 | 1167 | 1166 | What's the best way to get Titania working - that's what I want to know. Shouldn't take long I'm sure.
1886 | 1183 | 1182 | I wonder what's happened to my memory - or have I already asked you that?
1887 | 1211 | 1210 | I don't even know who I am any more. I'm a little teapot short and stout tip me up and.... uhh.... ummm..... oh.
1888 | 1191 | 1190 | Don't know. Don't care. Don't remember anything. What use is a robot with no memory? Might as well end it all now... can't remember how! ... Damn!
1889 | 1213 | 1212 | Don't know. Don't care. Stop bothering me.
1890 | 1215 | 1214 | Can't remember. Ask someone else. I'm sulking.
1891 | 1209 | 1208 | Who knows? Who cares? I don't.
1892 | 1189 | 1188 | Well I'm sure I will.
1893 | 1185 | 1184 | Oh. Sorry. Or have I already said that?
1894 | 1187 | 1186 | I wonder what's happened to my memory - or have I already asked you that?
1895 | 1179 | 1178 | What's the point of living? Not much if you ask me.
1896 | 1181 | 1180 | What's the best way to get off this ship? What's the most effective cure for sammhorroids? What's the reason for foot-odor? These are the questions that depress me.
1897 | 1205 | 1204 | I'm more interested in finding out who brought that damned parrot on board.
1898 | 1207 | 1206 | Don't know. And if I did it wouldn't do any good.
1899 | 1203 | 1202 | Who do I have to bribe to get me out of here - that's a rather more pertinent question.
1900 | 1151 | 1150 | Good question. When indeed. Don't ask me. Dodgy brain. Don't worry though - I'll be right as rain any minute.
1901 | 1153 | 1152 | When am I going to get my memory back? Did you ask that? No I did. I'll answer it: answer what..
1902 | 1155 | 1154 | When are the other passengers coming on board. I do love a busy ship.
1903 | 1147 | 1146 | When are we going to land anywhere? Soon I hope - there's quite a lot needs fixing round here.
1904 | 1149 | 1148 | When's Leovinus going to come along. I am looking forward to having one of our little chats.
1905 | 1161 | 1160 | Good question. When indeed. Don't ask me. Dodgy brain. And it's not getting any better.
1906 | 1163 | 1162 | When am I going to get my memory back? Did you ask that? No I did. I'll answer it: never, at this rate.
1907 | 1165 | 1164 | When are they going to bring on the dancing girls that's what I want to know. On second thoughts maybe we don't have any.
1908 | 1157 | 1156 | When is someone going to get this ship up and running again? At a guess, never.
1909 | 1159 | 1158 | When are you going to realize that you're not going to get anywhere until you've got an upgrade?
1910 | 1125 | 1124 | No use asking me. Not with my memory. Try later - who knows, I might have got better.
1911 | 1127 | 1126 | Not too hot on the old whereabouts type question I'm afraid. Memory seems to have popped out. Should be back later though.
1912 | 1129 | 1128 | Where's my memory gone, that's what I want to know. Perhaps if I just wait, it'll come home. I wonder if it will remember where to come to well if it doesn't it won't be worth having.
1913 | 1115 | 1114 | Where are you going to get the ingredients for the Titanic Titillator - that's a far more important question.
1914 | 1117 | 1116 | Where are you going to get an upgrade - that's a question that's worth thinking about.
1915 | 1119 | 1118 | Where did Scraliontis and Brobostigon hide everything? That's rather a jolly question.
1916 | 1121 | 1120 | Where did Brobostigon put Titania's eye? Still I'm sure you'll find it.
1917 | 1123 | 1122 | Where did Brobostigon's body end up? Can't have just disappeared.
1918 | 1141 | 1140 | No use asking me. Not with my memory. Doubt if I'll work again, not with a brain like this.
1919 | 1143 | 1142 | Not too hot on the old whereabouts type question I'm afraid. Memory seems to have popped out. Not coming back from the look of it.
1920 | 1145 | 1144 | Where's my memory gone, that's what I want to know. I doubt you'll be able to help.
1921 | 1131 | 1130 | Where are you going to acquire the skills necessary to remove us from this predicament. That's what bothers me.
1922 | 1133 | 1132 | Where did they put Nobby's head? I suppose we'll never know.
1923 | 1135 | 1134 | Where is Fortillian going to find starling puree. He's doomed if he doesn't you know.
1924 | 1137 | 1136 | Where did they get that parrot? Damned bird drives me mad.
1925 | 1139 | 1138 | Where did Brobostigon put Titania's mouth. I suppose we'll never know.
1926 | 1229 | 1228 | Don't know I'm afraid.
1927 | 1231 | 1230 | Why did the chicken cross... dammit what did the chicken do?
1928 | 1233 | 1232 | Mmm. Well, they're a law unto themselves, chickens.
1929 | 1235 | 1234 | Why did it do that?
1930 | 1237 | 1236 | Well, I think that's enough about chickens.
1931 | 1239 | 1238 | Extraordinary. What logical creatures they are.
1932 | 1241 | 1240 | Couldn't tell you. You probably don't need to know anyway.
1933 | 1217 | 1216 | Why indeed. I'm sure the answer's obvious and you'll find it. Try asking Krage.
1934 | 1219 | 1218 | Asking why implies there's some logical answer. Not in this case, I'm afraid.
1935 | 1221 | 1220 | Why doesn't someone change my settings? It would only take a minute.
1936 | 1223 | 1222 | Easy. Just pop up to the Sculpture Chamber and pull the lever.
1937 | 1225 | 1224 | Why doesn't Leovinus do something? I'm sure he'll get us out of this mess.
1938 | 1227 | 1226 | That's a tough one - I'm afraid I just don't know the answer.
1939 | 1249 | 1248 | Don't know why. Don't know anything anymore.
1940 | 1251 | 1250 | Why doesn't my memory work? That's what I want to know. I think...
1941 | 1253 | 1252 | Why have all the other chaps gone loopy. It's all going to end in tears you know.
1942 | 1243 | 1242 | What do I care? We're all doomed anyway.
1943 | 1245 | 1244 | Why did it have to be you when the universe is full of useful beings.
1944 | 1247 | 1246 | Why didn't I take that job as a holiday courier..
1945 | 627 | 626 | Haven't got a clue. Why not take it for a spin.
1946 | 635 | 634 | I've never been to this dreadful place in my life. I wouldn't trouble yourself with it - I'm sure that in a million light years we shall have no need of return.
1947 | 675 | 674 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me. He'll be right as rain any moment I'm sure.
1948 | 683 | 682 | Well I've no idea. Perhaps he was looking for butterflies and tripped?
1949 | 691 | 690 | Can't quite remember the old emergency drill today. Let's just ignore him - he'll probably go away.
1950 | 643 | 642 | Good Lord there's something in the pipe. Don't you worry though, somebody will look into that shortly. I wonder who?
1951 | 651 | 650 | Heaven only knows. We could always wait 'til it re-incarnates as a spider.
1952 | 667 | 666 | Could be the King of Kalpon for all I know. He'll wake up in a second and tell us.
1953 | 659 | 658 | I wonder if it always does that. I thought it was rather fun actually.
1954 | 699 | 698 | Heaven knows where we are but I'm sure it's not anywhere you want to be.
1955 | 625 | 624 | Just plug it in and the Succ-U-Bus will send you any where in the ship you want to go: what a joyously modern thing the old Titanic is eh?
1956 | 633 | 632 | This is perhaps the least important room on board. I wouldn't trouble yourself with it.
1957 | 673 | 672 | Dead I believe but I'm sure it's not as serious as it looks.
1958 | 681 | 680 | I know he had a slight difference of opinion with Leovinus - perhaps he took the honorable way out?
1959 | 689 | 688 | I think we'd better just leave him here. Who knows - he might feel better after a bit of peace and quiet.
1960 | 641 | 640 | Funny you should mention that. The Succ-U-Bus keeps complaining about it. Probably just a bit of food eh? Couldn't possibly be a body.
1961 | 649 | 648 | We'll call a plumb-bot and it'll be fixed in a jiffy.
1962 | 665 | 664 | That's Brobostigon. But don't you worry, I'm sure he's just playing about.
1963 | 657 | 656 | I've never seen it do that before. I'm sure someone will rectify the Succ-U-Bus immediately.
1964 | 697 | 696 | This is the bilge room and you really don't want to be here.
1965 | 631 | 630 | Haven't got a clue. I don't expect it works what ever it is.
1966 | 639 | 638 | I've never been to this dreadful place in my life. Doubtless knowing my luck I shall be visiting it again shortly.
1967 | 679 | 678 | There's a word for his condition but it momentarily escapes me.
1968 | 687 | 686 | I've no idea. I expect he was done away with and we're probably next in the queue.
1969 | 695 | 694 | Can't remember how many lives people have: he doesn't look as though he deserved more than the one.
1970 | 647 | 646 | Good Lord there's something in the pipe. It's probably my life support system. Or my pay. How do we get it out?
1971 | 655 | 654 | We probably have to get someone special in. Can't remember who though.
1972 | 671 | 670 | Haven't got a clue but I'll tell you something - whatever's happened to him I'll probably take the blame for it.
1973 | 663 | 662 | I wonder if it always does that. It's probably suffered a complete mental breakdown. I won't be far behind it at this rate.
1974 | 703 | 702 | Heaven knows where we are. but you certainly don't want to be here.. I certainly don't so far as I can be certain about anything.
1975 | 629 | 628 | Just plug it in and the Succ-U-Bus will send you any where in the ship you want to go: as if that's going to get us out of this mess.
1976 | 637 | 636 | This is perhaps the least important room on board. Doubtless knowing my luck I shall be visiting it again shortly.
1977 | 677 | 676 | Dead and there's not many comeback from there I can tell you.
1978 | 685 | 684 | He wasn't exactly mister popular. I expect someone had him mislaid.
1979 | 693 | 692 | Don't think it matters what we do with him. I expect it will turn out to be my fault anyway.
1980 | 645 | 644 | Funny you should mention that. The Succ-U-Bus keeps complaining about it. It's probably my life support system. Or my pay.
1981 | 653 | 652 | Call a plumb-bot. Not that it'll do much good. I've not seen one since we launched.
1982 | 669 | 668 | That's Brobostigon. And no-one's going to tell me he died a natural death.
1983 | 661 | 660 | I've never seen it do that before. I suppose that means they're broken all over the ship.
1984 | 701 | 700 | This is the bilge room and you really don't want to be here and neither do I.
