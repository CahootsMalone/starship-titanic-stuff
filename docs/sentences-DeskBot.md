16 | 1871 | 1870 | Behind you?
17 | 1083 | 1082 | Good.
18 | 1119 | 1118 | Terrific.
19 | 1123 | 1122 | Wholly predictable.
20 | 1127 | 1126 | I like that.
21 | 1131 | 1130 | Interesting.
22 | 1135 | 1134 | Intelligent response - for a sub-species.
23 | 1139 | 1138 | Mmm.
24 | 1143 | 1142 | Astounding.
25 | 1147 | 1146 | Mmm. Deeply uninteresting.
26 | 1149 | 1148 | I'm sorry, you're boring me.
27 | 1087 | 1086 | OK.
28 | 1153 | 1152 | I've had enough of this.
29 | 1157 | 1156 | You'll forgive me if I don't want to listen to you any more.
30 | 1161 | 1160 | Gosh you are dull.
31 | 1165 | 1164 | A word of wisdom: A higher standard of discourse is necessary to sustain my interest.
32 | 1167 | 1166 | I am sooooo bored!
33 | 1169 | 1168 | Lord I'm tired of this drivel.
34 | 1091 | 1090 | Yes indeed.
35 | 1095 | 1094 | That's fine.
36 | 1099 | 1098 | That's OK.
37 | 1103 | 1102 | All right, all right.
38 | 1107 | 1106 | Staggering.
39 | 1111 | 1110 | Outlandish.
40 | 1115 | 1114 | Perfect.
41 | 2067 | 2066 | But of course.
42 | 671 | 670 | My dear child, trying to catch me out with odd words will NOT get you that upgrade.
43 | 673 | 672 | I've said it before and I'll say it again. I have nothing more to say about Byzantine Numismatists.
44 | 1661 | 1660 | If I could do you think I'd be sitting here talking to you?
45 | 925 | 924 | I can't possibly tell you that.
46 | 929 | 928 | You've a real nerve asking a decent DeskBot a personal question like that. You'll get no help out of me today.
47 | 2219 | 2218 | Carry on.
48 | 2223 | 2222 | Continue.
49 | 2227 | 2226 | Tell me more.
50 | 2207 | 2206 | Charming.
51 | 2083 | 2082 | Company policy.
52 | 2339 | 2338 | Marsinta.
53 | 2375 | 2374 | Yes.
54 | 2635 | 2634 | Typical.
55 | 2639 | 2638 | It's never too late.
56 | 2643 | 2642 | I'm not a taxi.
57 | 2647 | 2646 | Many times.
58 | 2651 | 2650 | Not much recently.
59 | 2379 | 2378 | No.
60 | 2383 | 2382 | Well, maybe.
61 | 2387 | 2386 | Why?
62 | 2391 | 2390 | What for?
63 | 2395 | 2394 | Yes, I do too.
64 | 2399 | 2398 | Do you?
65 | 2403 | 2402 | That's good.
66 | 2407 | 2406 | Never heard of him.
67 | 2411 | 2410 | Never heard of her.
68 | 2343 | 2342 | I do.
69 | 2415 | 2414 | Never heard of them.
70 | 2419 | 2418 | What's one of those.
71 | 2423 | 2422 | You're awfully chatty.
72 | 2427 | 2426 | You're not saying much. Not that I'm complaining.
73 | 2431 | 2430 | That's right.
74 | 2435 | 2434 | Me too.
75 | 2439 | 2438 | All the time.
76 | 2443 | 2442 | Whatever you say.
77 | 2447 | 2446 | Not sure.
78 | 2451 | 2450 | Do what?
79 | 2347 | 2346 | I would.
80 | 2455 | 2454 | Not today thanks.
81 | 2459 | 2458 | I've no idea.
82 | 2463 | 2462 | It is.
83 | 2467 | 2466 | They do.
84 | 2471 | 2470 | They are.
85 | 2475 | 2474 | Could be.
86 | 2479 | 2478 | Sure is.
87 | 2483 | 2482 | What's the point in that?
88 | 2487 | 2486 | Oh, I see.
89 | 2491 | 2490 | Oh, I don't know.
90 | 2351 | 2350 | I wouldn't.
91 | 2495 | 2494 | Love it.
92 | 2499 | 2498 | Not so sure about that.
93 | 2503 | 2502 | I never was a great fan.
94 | 2507 | 2506 | They have.
95 | 2511 | 2510 | A little.
96 | 2515 | 2514 | I know.
97 | 2519 | 2518 | I should think not.
98 | 2523 | 2522 | Many times.
99 | 2527 | 2526 | Never again.
100 | 2531 | 2530 | I might.
101 | 2355 | 2354 | Really?
102 | 2535 | 2534 | It might.
103 | 2539 | 2538 | No can do.
104 | 2543 | 2542 | Well, I'm not.
105 | 2547 | 2546 | That's good.
106 | 2551 | 2550 | A hunch.
107 | 2239 | 2238 | I am.
108 | 2243 | 2242 | You're not.
109 | 2247 | 2246 | You are.
110 | 2251 | 2250 | You will.
111 | 2359 | 2358 | Would you?
112 | 2255 | 2254 | Oh.
113 | 2259 | 2258 | Oh dear.
114 | 2263 | 2262 | Me too.
115 | 2267 | 2266 | Please?
116 | 2271 | 2270 | Yeah, right.
117 | 2279 | 2278 | Isn't she?
118 | 2283 | 2282 | Isn't he?
119 | 2287 | 2286 | Aren't they?
120 | 2291 | 2290 | Won't they?
121 | 2295 | 2294 | Won't she?
122 | 2363 | 2362 | Do you?
123 | 2299 | 2298 | Won't he?
124 | 2303 | 2302 | Does he?
125 | 2307 | 2306 | Does she?
126 | 2311 | 2310 | Do they?
127 | 2315 | 2314 | Go on.
128 | 2319 | 2318 | Is that so?
129 | 2323 | 2322 | Is that right?
130 | 2327 | 2326 | My goodness.
131 | 2331 | 2330 | Uh oh.
132 | 2335 | 2334 | I see.
133 | 2367 | 2366 | Will you?
134 | 2555 | 2554 | No problem.
135 | 2559 | 2558 | That's right.
136 | 2563 | 2562 | Of course.
137 | 2567 | 2566 | Could be.
138 | 2571 | 2570 | Who?
139 | 2575 | 2574 | What?
140 | 2579 | 2578 | Where?
141 | 2583 | 2582 | Why?
142 | 2587 | 2586 | When?
143 | 2591 | 2590 | Is he?
144 | 2371 | 2370 | Are you sure?
145 | 2595 | 2594 | Is she?
146 | 2599 | 2598 | Are they?
147 | 2603 | 2602 | Will he?
148 | 2607 | 2606 | Will she?
149 | 2611 | 2610 | Will they?
150 | 2615 | 2614 | Did he?
151 | 2619 | 2618 | Did she?
152 | 2623 | 2622 | Did they?
153 | 2627 | 2626 | Just like you.
154 | 2631 | 2630 | Just like me.
155 | 2195 | 2194 | Delightful.
156 | 1483 | 1482 | Do you have a reservation?
157 | 1485 | 1484 | Wrong! Now let me ask you again, do you have a reservation?
158 | 957 | 956 | Well you've got me there. I'm afraid I just don't know.
159 | 1759 | 1758 | Don't you start.
160 | 2167 | 2166 | Everyday.
161 | 2027 | 2026 | Exactly.
162 | 2039 | 2038 | I expect not.
163 | 2035 | 2034 | I expect so.
164 | 1899 | 1898 | Fantastic!
165 | 715 | 714 | That's absolutely fine by me - I care very little what you do just as long as it doesn't create an unpleasant odor or disturb the other passengers.
166 | 717 | 716 | News of your embarkation sure did travel fast didn't it.
167 | 2163 | 2162 | First week of the month.
168 | 965 | 964 | Yes. I do believe SGT Class suits you. That distinctive lack of manners.
169 | 969 | 968 | What a rude, rude biped you are.
170 | 973 | 972 | Just because I'm a Bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
171 | 875 | 874 | Would you mind just going away and asking somebody else? I'm really very tired of you.
172 | 877 | 876 | Who cares?
173 | 879 | 878 | Good. Why don't you find a nice little hole somewhere and go and do your caring in it.
174 | 881 | 880 | Know what I think? I think you should give me a little more respect.
175 | 883 | 882 | If you really respected me - YOU'D LEAVE ME IN PEACE!!
176 | 885 | 884 | I can't tell you that.
177 | 889 | 888 | Because of the Reason.
178 | 1775 | 1774 | Why don't you go to the bar?
179 | 1787 | 1786 | Why don't you go to the bilge room?
180 | 1779 | 1778 | Why don't you go to the first class restaurant?
181 | 1783 | 1782 | Why don't you go to the music room?
182 | 1791 | 1790 | Why don't you go to the Parrot's lobby?
183 | 1795 | 1794 | Why don't you go to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant?
184 | 1619 | 1618 | Goodbye.
185 | 1503 | 1502 | I've got better things to do than sit here chatting.
186 | 1505 | 1504 | Yes, you do, don't you.
187 | 1507 | 1506 | I've nothing more to say.
188 | 1509 | 1508 | Run along with you, I've got a job to do.
189 | 1511 | 1510 | Talk to some of the other Bots who've got less important things to do than me!
190 | 1513 | 1512 | I'm busy! Gimme me a break.
191 | 1515 | 1514 | Help? Help? Help? Help yourself, why don't you?
192 | 1517 | 1516 | You want some help? Why don't you go and find out what's been going on around here!
193 | 2203 | 2202 | Great.
194 | 1743 | 1742 | Ha ha ha.
195 | 2023 | 2022 | That happens all the time.
196 | 651 | 650 | Oh this cruel, cruel world that has things you do not like within it.
197 | 655 | 654 | Is there anything I can do that might help?
198 | 633 | 632 | I wish I could do something. Unfortunately I'm waiting for a first class passenger to come along so I can help them.
199 | 635 | 634 | You know if you want an upgrade you're going to have to be a little more discreet about your likes and dislikes.
200 | 639 | 638 | I sympathize completely and will endeavor to do very little about it.
201 | 641 | 640 | I'm sorry to hear that. Next question.
202 | 643 | 642 | How dreadfully banal for you.
203 | 645 | 644 | Well, the universe wasn't created just for your pleasure. I know this for a fact because there are not foul, greasy burger bars on every corner.
204 | 627 | 626 | My, aren't we amusing when we have a head of steam up. I've never known a 3rd class passenger with the gall to express such likes and dislikes.
205 | 629 | 628 | How awful for you. As if I should care.
206 | 631 | 630 | Like, hate, aren't we just a maelstrom of emotions.
207 | 1635 | 1634 | You've wangled your way up to first class already. That's it.
208 | 2109 | 2108 | Have a nice day.
209 | 1019 | 1018 | And how are we today dear passenger?
210 | 1023 | 1022 | Yes well, you're obviously confusing me with a DeskBot who gives a damn.
211 | 1025 | 1024 | Greetings biped!
212 | 1047 | 1046 | How are you?
213 | 1055 | 1054 | Nice weather we're having.
214 | 573 | 572 | Fentible was telling me there's a body up in the First Class Restaurant. Not that it's any business of mine of course.
215 | 599 | 598 | If I were you I'd pay a visit to the Music Room.
216 | 601 | 600 | My word Marsinta you are being helpful today.
217 | 605 | 604 | If you aren't satisfied with the Super Galactic Traveler room perhaps you should read the in-flight magazine to take your mind off it.
218 | 607 | 606 | If you really want to be helpful perhaps you could work out why the cyberintelligence appears to be out of control.
219 | 609 | 608 | Might I suggest a detailed examination of Titania's Chamber - after all, that's where the controls are.
220 | 613 | 612 | Perhaps you should watch a little more TV. Last time I looked there was something very odd going on in one of the first class staterooms.
221 | 615 | 614 | I'm no scandal monger but did you hear there's a body in the First Class Restaurant? Krage was telling me the service has gone completely to pieces.
222 | 617 | 616 | I did hear there's a body in the Bilge Room. But then I suppose there's always a body in the Bilge Room.
223 | 619 | 618 | Search the bodies, that's what I'd do if I wasn't stuck behind this damn desk.
224 | 621 | 620 | If I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
225 | 575 | 574 | Fentible was telling me there's a body down in the bilge room. Not that I make it a habit to listen to tittle tattle of course.
226 | 625 | 624 | You have to be pretty clever to defuse a bomb like that you know.
227 | 577 | 576 | I believe you require a crushed television? Have you tried asking the BellBot?
228 | 579 | 578 | You should visit the Arboretum - I believe one can change the weather up there.
229 | 581 | 580 | I believe you require lemons. The Arboretum would be a good place to start looking.
230 | 585 | 584 | I hear they have lemon trees in the Arboretum you know.
231 | 587 | 586 | Might I suggest you visit the Bar and see if you can help the BarBot with his Titanic Titillator.
232 | 589 | 588 | A simple method of crushing a TV would be to get the BellBot to throw one off the Top of the Well.
233 | 593 | 592 | They have starlings up on the Promenade Deck you know. I'm sure you of all people will find a way of squashing them.
234 | 595 | 594 | I've always suspected that the drains on the Promenade Deck lead down into the Super Galactic Traveler food system. Perhaps that's where you might find the starling pur$e?
235 | 597 | 596 | If you're not satisfied with the way I'm treating you, you're quite at liberty to go to the Sculpture Chamber and change my settings.
236 | 1631 | 1630 | You get upgrades from me, and I don't give 'em.
237 | 1593 | 1592 | As well as I need to be thank you.
238 | 1051 | 1050 | I'm terrific.
239 | 1597 | 1596 | Oh, I'm just worried about what's happened to Titania.
240 | 1883 | 1882 | How come?
241 | 1569 | 1568 | Ask the BellBot!
242 | 1541 | 1540 | Does the phrase 'distributed intelligence' mean anything to you, because that's what I think we've got here. I could go on.
243 | 1543 | 1542 | Damn fool system design. Each of her primary functions was localized in just one lobe. Take those lobes away and the whole thing is disabled. Stupid! I could go on!
244 | 1545 | 1544 | Well, that's what I think they did. You want to know who I mean? I could go on...
245 | 1547 | 1546 | Scraliontis and Brobostigon, that's who! I think they took her brain apart! I could go on!
246 | 1549 | 1548 | It's a pity you don't have any brains yourself or you might be able to find what happened to all the bits! I could say more!
247 | 1551 | 1550 | But I won't...
248 | 1915 | 1914 | How much?
249 | 1647 | 1646 | You think this is just a game do you?
250 | 1565 | 1564 | Get in them. Use them.
251 | 1903 | 1902 | How did you know?
252 | 1979 | 1978 | How do you think?
253 | 2095 | 2094 | I agree.
254 | 1935 | 1934 | I'm amazing.
255 | 1939 | 1938 | I'm a bot.
256 | 1577 | 1576 | So go eat!
257 | 2235 | 2234 | I'm not.
258 | 2043 | 2042 | I'd be very surprised.
259 | 1747 | 1746 | I could.
260 | 1751 | 1750 | I could go on.
261 | 1753 | 1752 | I could say more.
262 | 1733 | 1732 | I did.
263 | 1737 | 1736 | I didn't.
264 | 1725 | 1724 | I do.
265 | 1729 | 1728 | I don't.
266 | 2007 | 2006 | I don't think so.
267 | 1843 | 1842 | I don't understand.
268 | 1847 | 1846 | I still don't understand.
269 | 1851 | 1850 | I'm really having a lot of difficulty understanding this.
270 | 1679 | 1678 | I know that.
271 | 1623 | 1622 | Let me correct you. the Parrot IS APPALLING.
272 | 2047 | 2046 | I wouldn't be at all surprised.
273 | 1705 | 1704 | Oh I see.
274 | 1839 | 1838 | I understand.
275 | 2183 | 2182 | Indeed.
276 | 1959 | 1958 | Interesting.
277 | 2087 | 2086 | It is.
278 | 2091 | 2090 | It isn't.
279 | 2075 | 2074 | Oh it's you again.
280 | 2015 | 2014 | Just because.
281 | 1655 | 1654 | They tell you what class you're in.
282 | 1895 | 1894 | Lovely!
283 | 1907 | 1906 | Many's the time.
284 | 2655 | 2654 | It's a marketing term.
285 | 1639 | 1638 | And human is a weird species.
286 | 845 | 844 | Maybe.
287 | 1615 | 1614 | Maybe.
288 | 849 | 848 | Maybe, maybe not.
289 | 853 | 852 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
290 | 857 | 856 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
291 | 861 | 860 | Could be.
292 | 865 | 864 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
293 | 869 | 868 | Good question. Allow me not to answer it.
294 | 871 | 870 | Good question. Let's not spoil it with an answer.
295 | 873 | 872 | To be honest, I don't really care.
296 | 2113 | 2112 | Missing you already.
297 | 2191 | 2190 | Neat.
298 | 1963 | 1962 | Never.
299 | 897 | 896 | Never.
300 | 901 | 900 | All the time.
301 | 905 | 904 | Sometimes.
302 | 909 | 908 | Often.
303 | 913 | 912 | Occasionally.
304 | 917 | 916 | Hardly ever.
305 | 921 | 920 | When the mood's right.
306 | 931 | 930 | That'll be the day.
307 | 933 | 932 | From time to time.
308 | 2187 | 2186 | Nice.
309 | 1029 | 1028 | Possibly. Let's give it a little time.
310 | 1033 | 1032 | Jury's still out on that one.
311 | 1035 | 1034 | Good to meet you too.
312 | 1039 | 1038 | The pleasure's all yours. Ha.
313 | 1043 | 1042 | See how you feel when we get to Vastan.
314 | 1045 | 1044 | It's our destination blunderhead.
315 | 1695 | 1694 | No.
316 | 777 | 776 | No.
317 | 811 | 810 | No way.
318 | 813 | 812 | You have got to be kidding.
319 | 815 | 814 | Never.
320 | 817 | 816 | Ha! Over my dead body.
321 | 819 | 818 | Not a chance.
322 | 821 | 820 | Not a hope.
323 | 825 | 824 | Nope.
324 | 829 | 828 | Out of the question.
325 | 831 | 830 | Wrong.
326 | 833 | 832 | That is one of the stupidest questions I have ever heard.
327 | 781 | 780 | No no no no no no no!!!!
328 | 835 | 834 | All that expensive training - and I have to deal with sub-species like you. NO!
329 | 841 | 840 | The answer's no. You know something, I'm sure you were better suited to third class.
330 | 843 | 842 | No. Absolutely N O. I am beginning to regret ever having upgraded you.
331 | 1605 | 1604 | No.
332 | 2275 | 2274 | No way.
333 | 785 | 784 | No.
334 | 837 | 836 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
335 | 789 | 788 | No.
336 | 793 | 792 | No.
337 | 797 | 796 | No.
338 | 801 | 800 | No.
339 | 805 | 804 | No.
340 | 1467 | 1466 | The BarBot is a mendacious, time-wasting fool.
341 | 2079 | 2078 | I'm afraid that's not company policy.
342 | 1761 | 1760 | I don't wish to speak about that.
343 | 2055 | 2054 | That's not what I heard.
344 | 1691 | 1690 | Of course.
345 | 1699 | 1698 | Of course not.
346 | 1709 | 1708 | Ok.
347 | 1481 | 1480 | Welcome guest number... er, one, to the Starship Titanic, the most glamorous galactic cruiseship experience in the whole of the space-time continuum, more fabulous than mortal tongue can say, stupendous, gorgeous, above all the ship that cannot possibly go wrong. Ha! I am the DeskBot. I am here to welcome you on board and allocate you to your overwhelmingly lovely stateroom. And who might you be?
348 | 937 | 936 | I'm sure you're right.
349 | 941 | 940 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
350 | 945 | 944 | Absolutely.
351 | 949 | 948 | Without a doubt.
352 | 1859 | 1858 | Over there!
353 | 1863 | 1862 | Over there?
354 | 2117 | 2116 | I don't wish to be rude - well in fact I do, so pig's bladder to you.
355 | 1887 | 1886 | It's a possibility.
356 | 1999 | 1998 | Possibly.
357 | 2003 | 2002 | Possibly not.
358 | 2031 | 2030 | Precisely.
359 | 1003 | 1002 | At the risk of repeating myself -
360 | 1007 | 1006 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again -
361 | 1011 | 1010 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times -
362 | 1015 | 1014 | Didn't you just say that didn't you just say that didn't you just say that - see what it's like?
363 | 1991 | 1990 | Probably.
364 | 1995 | 1994 | Probably not.
365 | 767 | 766 | Oh how sweet! You got another question right and you have such a tiny tiny brain!
366 | 771 | 770 | Extraordinary. I've detected no signs of intelligent life - and yet you got a question right.
367 | 1471 | 1470 | Do you have science on your planet? How terribly forward of you.
368 | 1475 | 1474 | Of course by your standards a Blerontin donut would probably qualify as a scientist.
369 | 1721 | 1720 | Really?
370 | 993 | 992 | You're repeating yourself dear.
371 | 997 | 996 | I do believe I heard that question the first time round.
372 | 999 | 998 | You know dear, repeating a stupid question does not increase its chances of being answered.
373 | 2199 | 2198 | Repugnant.
374 | 1875 | 1874 | Right here!
375 | 977 | 976 | Ah, good day. Marsinta here ready to do her best.
376 | 981 | 980 | Ahoy passenger! How can Marsinta help you today?.
377 | 985 | 984 | Yes, you can ring my bell any time.
378 | 989 | 988 | Yes? May I help you?
379 | 1947 | 1946 | You can say that again.
380 | 1075 | 1074 | Come on snap out of it!
381 | 1077 | 1076 | Look, I haven't got all day. Did you want something?
382 | 1079 | 1078 | Over here lard-head!
383 | 1081 | 1080 | I'm running out of patience. If you don't want to talk to me - fine!
384 | 661 | 660 | Well aren't we the clever one.
385 | 1967 | 1966 | Sometimes.
386 | 1487 | 1486 | Yes?
387 | 1489 | 1488 | You spaced?
388 | 1491 | 1490 | HELLO? HELLO?
389 | 1493 | 1492 | Did you fail to say something?
390 | 1249 | 1248 | but I'm not too sure.
391 | 1285 | 1284 | but I'm having a little trouble working out.
392 | 1253 | 1252 | but I'm not quite certain.
393 | 1257 | 1256 | but I can't quite absolutely recall.
394 | 1261 | 1260 | but I'm having a little trouble remembering.
395 | 1265 | 1264 | but it appears to have slipped my memory.
396 | 1269 | 1268 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
397 | 1273 | 1272 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
398 | 1277 | 1276 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
399 | 1281 | 1280 | but I couldn't say with total certainty.
400 | 1211 | 1210 | , and I doubt you'll ever understand,
401 | 1245 | 1244 | , and I must say it's quite a rare event for me,
402 | 1215 | 1214 | , and I rather hope you'll take it personally,
403 | 1219 | 1218 | , and you certainly mustn't blame anyone for it,
404 | 1223 | 1222 | , and I'm quite prepared to take the blame myself for it,
405 | 1227 | 1226 | , and don't even think about blaming anyone,
406 | 1231 | 1230 | , and I'd appreciate it if you kept it to yourself,
407 | 1233 | 1232 | , and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally,
408 | 1237 | 1236 | , and I'd say this to any of the passengers,
409 | 1241 | 1240 | , and I must say it doesn't often happen to me,
410 | 1289 | 1288 | how.
411 | 1327 | 1326 | why you're going to do that.
412 | 1331 | 1330 | why you keep asking these dumbass questions.
413 | 1335 | 1334 | why you think that's relevant.
414 | 1339 | 1338 | why you persist in being such an idiot.
415 | 1343 | 1342 | why you insist on acting in such a stupid manner.
416 | 1347 | 1346 | why you continue to act so strangely.
417 | 1351 | 1350 | who.
418 | 1355 | 1354 | who you mean.
419 | 1359 | 1358 | who did it.
420 | 1363 | 1362 | who moved it.
421 | 1293 | 1292 | how it works.
422 | 1367 | 1366 | who took it.
423 | 1371 | 1370 | who hid it.
424 | 1375 | 1374 | where.
425 | 1379 | 1378 | where it is.
426 | 1383 | 1382 | where they are.
427 | 1387 | 1386 | where it went.
428 | 1391 | 1390 | where they went.
429 | 1395 | 1394 | where it could be.
430 | 1399 | 1398 | where they could be.
431 | 1403 | 1402 | where he is.
432 | 1297 | 1296 | how you might solve that.
433 | 1407 | 1406 | where she is.
434 | 1411 | 1410 | when.
435 | 1415 | 1414 | when we're going to arrive.
436 | 1419 | 1418 | when that happened.
437 | 1423 | 1422 | when - if at all.
438 | 1427 | 1426 | when that'll happen.
439 | 1431 | 1430 | what.
440 | 1435 | 1434 | what that is.
441 | 1439 | 1438 | what you ought to do with it.
442 | 1443 | 1442 | what it does.
443 | 1301 | 1300 | how you might get that.
444 | 1447 | 1446 | what they do.
445 | 1451 | 1450 | what he does.
446 | 1455 | 1454 | what she does.
447 | 1459 | 1458 | what I mean any more.
448 | 1303 | 1302 | how you might get them.
449 | 1309 | 1308 | how you might go there.
450 | 1313 | 1312 | why.
451 | 1317 | 1316 | why that happens
452 | 1321 | 1320 | why you want to do that.
453 | 1171 | 1170 | The thing is
454 | 1207 | 1206 | It distresses me deeply to have to say this
455 | 1175 | 1174 | The trouble is
456 | 1179 | 1178 | As it happens
457 | 1183 | 1182 | It's rather embarrassing
458 | 1187 | 1186 | I feel deeply ill at ease saying this
459 | 1191 | 1190 | The odd thing is
460 | 1195 | 1194 | The funny thing is
461 | 1199 | 1198 | This isn't logical
462 | 1203 | 1202 | This is something I never thought I'd say
463 | 1951 | 1950 | Stop it!
464 | 2231 | 2230 | Tell me less.
465 | 1955 | 1954 | Oh, yes, that's good.
466 | 2019 | 2018 | That's normal.
467 | 1923 | 1922 | That's amazing.
468 | 1919 | 1918 | That's good.
469 | 1687 | 1686 | That's right.
470 | 2127 | 2126 | The day after.
471 | 2123 | 2122 | The day before.
472 | 1855 | 1854 | There!
473 | 1651 | 1650 | If this is a game, you're obviously a loser.
474 | 1891 | 1890 | Thought so.
475 | 2131 | 2130 | Hammerday.
476 | 2135 | 2134 | Rowday.
477 | 2139 | 2138 | Welday.
478 | 2143 | 2142 | Harday.
479 | 2147 | 2146 | Spryday.
480 | 2151 | 2150 | Otherday.
481 | 2155 | 2154 | Flatterday.
482 | 2159 | 2158 | Umph.
483 | 2119 | 2118 | Today is.
484 | 2179 | 2178 | Undoubtedly.
485 | 2063 | 2062 | Very good.
486 | 1463 | 1462 | Dear child you are out of your depth. Have you tried the Bar?
487 | 1573 | 1572 | Tough!
488 | 1059 | 1058 | What kind of fool are you? We're in deep space you dunderhead.
489 | 1061 | 1060 | What kind of worb-brained statement is that? Planets have weather. Space has absence of weather.
490 | 1063 | 1062 | You like weather? How charming.
491 | 1067 | 1066 | If you like weather - we've got the lot here.
492 | 1071 | 1070 | Look, if you like weather go up to the Arboretum - you can play with the weather till the clouds come home.
493 | 1717 | 1716 | What?
494 | 953 | 952 | Dear child you are SO ignorant. Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
495 | 1643 | 1642 | Never you mind about the frogs.
496 | 1519 | 1518 | That's what I want to know! I don't get to see much sitting here, and since Titania's been down I'm off the network!
497 | 2051 | 2050 | That's what I heard.
498 | 2215 | 2214 | What an idea.
499 | 1589 | 1588 | Time you did something useful.
500 | 1531 | 1530 | Overrated, overspecified, undertested piece of cyberjunk! I could go on!
501 | 1533 | 1532 | Titania's meant to run everything on this ship. Can't even run herself. I could go on.
502 | 1535 | 1534 | Titania's done a complete system crash! And where does that leave all of us Bots? Just running random code in the dark! I could go on.
503 | 1537 | 1536 | Someone needs to go and pull her together. I'd suggest you only you don't look remotely up to the job. I could go on.
504 | 1539 | 1538 | But I won't...
505 | 893 | 892 | Sorry, can't tell you.
506 | 2071 | 2070 | Well what a surprise.
507 | 1563 | 1562 | Brain dead.
508 | 1987 | 1986 | What do you think?
509 | 961 | 960 | Marsinta Drewbish at your service.
510 | 1975 | 1974 | Whatever.
511 | 2059 | 2058 | Whatever you say.
512 | 1627 | 1626 | I don't think you'll be needing anything like that here on this ship.
513 | 663 | 662 | Trying to get some peace and quiet I expect.
514 | 1581 | 1580 | I don't know. A laundromat? A bank? Tell you what, why not try a restaurant? Sounds like a crazy idea, but it might just work.
515 | 1585 | 1584 | Super Galactic Traveler restaurant on any Super Galactic traveler floor. 1st class restaurant, go along the 1st class canal. 2nd class restaurant - come back when it's been built.
516 | 1879 | 1878 | I wouldn't know where to begin.
517 | 665 | 664 | A man whose stomach's had more upgrades than were good for him.
518 | 667 | 666 | A genius in all respects but one: he has NO idea how much a DeskBot's station should incorporate a little privacy.
519 | 669 | 668 | Scraliontis? The Accountant I believe. Half weasel half man.
520 | 1713 | 1712 | Why?
521 | 1983 | 1982 | Why do you think?
522 | 1683 | 1682 | Yes.
523 | 675 | 674 | Oh yes!
524 | 697 | 696 | Yes?
525 | 699 | 698 | Yes. Or do I mean no? It's such fun to tease. It's yes. Yes yes yes yes yes.
526 | 701 | 700 | No. All right. Yes.
527 | 703 | 702 | You are so right, but then you always are.
528 | 707 | 706 | Yes. Divine.
529 | 709 | 708 | In spite of your tragic dress sense you're actually quite bright aren't you?
530 | 713 | 712 | Well who am I to disagree with you.
531 | 711 | 710 | And foolish too.
532 | 719 | 718 | Help yourself.
533 | 723 | 722 | Right.
534 | 727 | 726 | Yes indeed.
535 | 731 | 730 | Well it certainly looks that way.
536 | 679 | 678 | Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes!!!!
537 | 735 | 734 | You'd better believe it.
538 | 739 | 738 | Of course.
539 | 743 | 742 | Go ahead.
540 | 747 | 746 | Do what you want.
541 | 751 | 750 | Definitely.
542 | 755 | 754 | Not a doubt.
543 | 759 | 758 | It's a sure thing.
544 | 763 | 762 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
545 | 775 | 774 | Well this medical breakthrough must be broadcast throughout the galaxy. The termite in SGT Class made an intelligent remark.
546 | 1601 | 1600 | Yes.
547 | 681 | 680 | Yes.
548 | 685 | 684 | Yes.
549 | 687 | 686 | Yes.
550 | 689 | 688 | Yes.
551 | 691 | 690 | Yes.
552 | 693 | 692 | Yes.
553 | 695 | 694 | Yes.
554 | 2175 | 2174 | Yes, and what fun it is.
555 | 2171 | 2170 | Yes, and what fun it was.
556 | 1927 | 1926 | You're amazing.
557 | 1943 | 1942 | Oh, you're really clever.
558 | 1931 | 1930 | You're an idiot.
559 | 1911 | 1910 | You reckon?
560 | 2101 | 2100 | You're right.
561 | 2105 | 2104 | You're wrong.
562 | 2213 | 2212 | Absurd.
563 | 1767 | 1766 | That's really all I know, dear.
564 | 1973 | 1972 | All the time.
565 | 1813 | 1812 | You should ask the BarBot that.
566 | 1833 | 1832 | You ought to talk to the BarBot about that.
567 | 1677 | 1676 | Have you tried asking the BellBot about that dear?
568 | 1801 | 1800 | You should ask the BellBot that.
569 | 1821 | 1820 | You ought to talk to the BellBot about that.
570 | 1673 | 1672 | The DoorBot might be able to help you with that dear.
571 | 1805 | 1804 | You should ask the DoorBot that.
572 | 1825 | 1824 | You ought to talk to the DoorBot about that.
573 | 1809 | 1808 | You should ask the LiftBot that.
574 | 1829 | 1828 | You ought to talk to the LiftBot about that.
575 | 1817 | 1816 | You should ask the Maitre d'Bot that.
576 | 1837 | 1836 | You ought to talk to the Maitre d'Bot about that.
577 | 2013 | 2012 | Because I say so.
578 | 1869 | 1868 | Behind you!
579 | 1873 | 1872 | Behind you?
580 | 1085 | 1084 | Good.
581 | 1121 | 1120 | Terrific.
582 | 1125 | 1124 | Wholly predictable.
583 | 1129 | 1128 | I like that.
584 | 1133 | 1132 | Interesting.
585 | 1137 | 1136 | Intelligent response.
586 | 1141 | 1140 | Mmm.
587 | 1145 | 1144 | Astounding.
588 | 1151 | 1150 | I'm sorry dear, that's enough for now.
589 | 1089 | 1088 | OK.
590 | 1155 | 1154 | You'll forgive me if I take a little break dear.
591 | 1159 | 1158 | You'll forgive me if I don't want to listen to you any more.
592 | 1163 | 1162 | I am a little tired.
593 | 1093 | 1092 | Yes indeed.
594 | 1097 | 1096 | That's fine.
595 | 1101 | 1100 | That's OK.
596 | 1105 | 1104 | All right, all right.
597 | 1109 | 1108 | Staggering.
598 | 1113 | 1112 | Outlandish.
599 | 1117 | 1116 | Perfect.
600 | 2069 | 2068 | But of course.
601 | 1663 | 1662 | Depends who's asking, dear.
602 | 1665 | 1664 | Well, no dear. You're very nice, of course, but you're not really my type.
603 | 927 | 926 | I can't possibly tell you that.
604 | 2221 | 2220 | Carry on.
605 | 2225 | 2224 | Continue.
606 | 2229 | 2228 | Tell me more.
607 | 2209 | 2208 | Charming.
608 | 2085 | 2084 | Company policy.
609 | 2341 | 2340 | Marsinta.
610 | 2377 | 2376 | Yes.
611 | 2637 | 2636 | Typical.
612 | 2641 | 2640 | It's never too late.
613 | 2645 | 2644 | I'm not a taxi.
614 | 2649 | 2648 | Many times.
615 | 2653 | 2652 | Not much recently.
616 | 2381 | 2380 | No.
617 | 2385 | 2384 | Well, maybe.
618 | 2389 | 2388 | Why?
619 | 2393 | 2392 | What for?
620 | 2397 | 2396 | Yes, I do too.
621 | 2401 | 2400 | Do you?
622 | 2405 | 2404 | That's good.
623 | 2409 | 2408 | Never heard of him.
624 | 2413 | 2412 | Never heard of her.
625 | 2345 | 2344 | I do.
626 | 2417 | 2416 | Never heard of them.
627 | 2421 | 2420 | What's one of those.
628 | 2425 | 2424 | You're awfully chatty.
629 | 2429 | 2428 | You're not saying much. Not that I'm complaining.
630 | 2433 | 2432 | That's right.
631 | 2437 | 2436 | Me too.
632 | 2441 | 2440 | All the time.
633 | 2445 | 2444 | Whatever you say.
634 | 2449 | 2448 | Not sure.
635 | 2453 | 2452 | Do what?
636 | 2349 | 2348 | I would.
637 | 2457 | 2456 | Not today thanks.
638 | 2461 | 2460 | I've no idea.
639 | 2465 | 2464 | It is.
640 | 2469 | 2468 | They do.
641 | 2473 | 2472 | They are.
642 | 2477 | 2476 | Could be.
643 | 2481 | 2480 | Sure is.
644 | 2485 | 2484 | What's the point in that?
645 | 2489 | 2488 | Oh, I see.
646 | 2493 | 2492 | Oh, I don't know.
647 | 2353 | 2352 | I wouldn't.
648 | 2497 | 2496 | Love it.
649 | 2501 | 2500 | Not so sure about that.
650 | 2505 | 2504 | I never was a great fan.
651 | 2509 | 2508 | They have.
652 | 2513 | 2512 | A little.
653 | 2517 | 2516 | I know.
654 | 2521 | 2520 | I should think not.
655 | 2525 | 2524 | Many times.
656 | 2529 | 2528 | Never again.
657 | 2533 | 2532 | I might.
658 | 2357 | 2356 | Really?
659 | 2537 | 2536 | It might.
660 | 2541 | 2540 | No can do.
661 | 2545 | 2544 | Well, I'm not.
662 | 2549 | 2548 | That's good.
663 | 2553 | 2552 | A hunch.
664 | 2241 | 2240 | I am.
665 | 2245 | 2244 | You're not.
666 | 2249 | 2248 | You are.
667 | 2253 | 2252 | You will.
668 | 2361 | 2360 | Would you?
669 | 2257 | 2256 | Oh.
670 | 2261 | 2260 | Oh dear.
671 | 2265 | 2264 | Me too.
672 | 2269 | 2268 | Please?
673 | 2273 | 2272 | Yeah, right.
674 | 2281 | 2280 | Isn't she?
675 | 2285 | 2284 | Isn't he?
676 | 2289 | 2288 | Aren't they?
677 | 2293 | 2292 | Won't they?
678 | 2297 | 2296 | Won't she?
679 | 2365 | 2364 | Do you?
680 | 2301 | 2300 | Won't he?
681 | 2305 | 2304 | Does he?
682 | 2309 | 2308 | Does she?
683 | 2313 | 2312 | Do they?
684 | 2317 | 2316 | Go on.
685 | 2321 | 2320 | Is that so?
686 | 2325 | 2324 | Is that right?
687 | 2329 | 2328 | My goodness.
688 | 2333 | 2332 | Uh oh.
689 | 2337 | 2336 | I see.
690 | 2369 | 2368 | Will you?
691 | 2557 | 2556 | No problem.
692 | 2561 | 2560 | That's right.
693 | 2565 | 2564 | Of course.
694 | 2569 | 2568 | Could be.
695 | 2573 | 2572 | Who?
696 | 2577 | 2576 | What?
697 | 2581 | 2580 | Where?
698 | 2585 | 2584 | Why?
699 | 2589 | 2588 | When?
700 | 2593 | 2592 | Is he?
701 | 2373 | 2372 | Are you sure?
702 | 2597 | 2596 | Is she?
703 | 2601 | 2600 | Are they?
704 | 2605 | 2604 | Will he?
705 | 2609 | 2608 | Will she?
706 | 2613 | 2612 | Will they?
707 | 2617 | 2616 | Did he?
708 | 2621 | 2620 | Did she?
709 | 2625 | 2624 | Did they?
710 | 2629 | 2628 | Just like you.
711 | 2633 | 2632 | Just like me.
712 | 1769 | 1768 | Dear oh dear, dear.
713 | 2197 | 2196 | Delightful.
714 | 959 | 958 | Well you've got me there. I'm afraid I just don't know.
715 | 1763 | 1762 | I have nothing more to say.
716 | 2169 | 2168 | Everyday.
717 | 2029 | 2028 | Exactly.
718 | 2041 | 2040 | I expect not.
719 | 2037 | 2036 | I expect so.
720 | 1669 | 1668 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? I know, even those big rooms can get a bit stuffy after a while can't they? Give me your PET.
721 | 1901 | 1900 | Fantastic!
722 | 2165 | 2164 | First week of the month.
723 | 967 | 966 | I rather like it.
724 | 971 | 970 | What a rude, rude biped you are.
725 | 975 | 974 | Just because I'm a Bot there's no reason to treat me like one.
726 | 887 | 886 | I can't tell you that.
727 | 891 | 890 | Because of the Reason.
728 | 1777 | 1776 | Why don't you go to the bar?
729 | 1789 | 1788 | Why don't you go to the bilge room?
730 | 1781 | 1780 | Why don't you go to the first class restaurant?
731 | 1785 | 1784 | Why don't you go to the music room?
732 | 1793 | 1792 | Why don't you go to the Parrot's lobby?
733 | 1797 | 1796 | Why don't you go to the Super Galactic Traveler Class Restaurant?
734 | 1773 | 1772 | Good for you, dear.
735 | 1621 | 1620 | Goodbye, dear.
736 | 2205 | 2204 | Great.
737 | 1745 | 1744 | Ha ha ha, dear.
738 | 2025 | 2024 | That happens all the time.
739 | 647 | 646 | If there's anything I can do you must let me know immediately.
740 | 649 | 648 | I do so wish I could make you happier.
741 | 653 | 652 | Oh this cruel, cruel world that has things you do not like within it.
742 | 657 | 656 | Is there anything I can do that might help?
743 | 659 | 658 | I am most terribly, terribly sorry.
744 | 637 | 636 | You know if you want an upgrade you're going to have to be a little more discreet about your likes and dislikes.
745 | 1637 | 1636 | I wish I could upgrade you again dear, but you're first class already.
746 | 2111 | 2110 | Have a nice day.
747 | 1741 | 1740 | I'll have to think about that dear.
748 | 1021 | 1020 | And how are we today dear passenger?
749 | 1027 | 1026 | Greetings biped!
750 | 1049 | 1048 | How are you?
751 | 1057 | 1056 | Nice weather we're having, dear.
752 | 603 | 602 | My word Marsinta you are being helpful today.
753 | 611 | 610 | Might I suggest a detailed examination of Titania's Chamber - after all, that's where the controls are.
754 | 623 | 622 | If I were you I'd defuse the bomb before it goes off.
755 | 583 | 582 | I hear they have lemon trees in the Arboretum you know.
756 | 591 | 590 | They have starlings up on the Promenade Deck you know. I'm sure you of all people will find a way of squashing them.
757 | 1633 | 1632 | You ask me very nicely, dear, and then I see what I can do.
758 | 1595 | 1594 | Oh, as well as can be expected, dear, under the circumstances.
759 | 1053 | 1052 | I'm terrific.
760 | 1599 | 1598 | Oh, well dear, I'm just worried about what's happened to Titania.
761 | 1885 | 1884 | How come?
762 | 1571 | 1570 | Ask the BellBot, dear.
763 | 1553 | 1552 | Well, first of all, dear, I think we need to find out what's happened to her. I could say more...
764 | 1555 | 1554 | I think her brain has been taken to pieces! It's a terrible thing to say about someone, but that's all I can think!
765 | 1557 | 1556 | So all the different bits of her grey matter..., well her colored, glassy matter, I should say have been taken away and hidden. That's what I think. And I could say more.
766 | 1559 | 1558 | By Scraliontis and Brobostigon! Such nice men in their way, but I think they've been led astray. Probably by each other! If you could find some of the pieces I think that would be a help!
767 | 1917 | 1916 | How much?
768 | 1649 | 1648 | What game dear? I didn't know there were any games aboard.
769 | 1567 | 1566 | Well I'm sure the LiftBot will help you, that's what he's there for.
770 | 1905 | 1904 | How did you know?
771 | 1981 | 1980 | How do you think?
772 | 2097 | 2096 | I agree.
773 | 1937 | 1936 | I'm amazing.
774 | 1941 | 1940 | I'm a bot.
775 | 1579 | 1578 | I think that's nature's way of telling you to go and eat something, dear.
776 | 2237 | 2236 | I'm not.
777 | 2045 | 2044 | I'd be very surprised.
778 | 1749 | 1748 | I could.
779 | 1755 | 1754 | I could go on.
780 | 1757 | 1756 | I could say more.
781 | 1735 | 1734 | I did.
782 | 1739 | 1738 | I didn't.
783 | 2099 | 2098 | I disagree.
784 | 1727 | 1726 | I do.
785 | 1731 | 1730 | I don't.
786 | 2009 | 2008 | I don't think so.
787 | 1845 | 1844 | I don't understand.
788 | 1849 | 1848 | I still don't understand.
789 | 1853 | 1852 | I'm really having a lot of difficulty understanding this.
790 | 1681 | 1680 | I know, dear.
791 | 1625 | 1624 | That's very sweet of you dear, but I'm afraid you're wrong. the Parrot is not a nice bird.
792 | 2049 | 2048 | I wouldn't be at all surprised.
793 | 1707 | 1706 | Oh I see, dear.
794 | 1841 | 1840 | I understand.
795 | 2185 | 2184 | Indeed.
796 | 1961 | 1960 | Interesting.
797 | 2089 | 2088 | It is.
798 | 2093 | 2092 | It isn't.
799 | 2077 | 2076 | Oh it's you again.
800 | 2017 | 2016 | Just because.
801 | 1657 | 1656 | They tell you what class you're in, dear.
802 | 1897 | 1896 | Lovely!
803 | 1909 | 1908 | Many's the time.
804 | 2657 | 2656 | It's just what we call it dear.
805 | 1641 | 1640 | Well, I'm rather attached to it, dear.
806 | 847 | 846 | Maybe.
807 | 1617 | 1616 | Maybe.
808 | 851 | 850 | Maybe, maybe not.
809 | 855 | 854 | I wouldn't say no - but then again I wouldn't say yes.
810 | 859 | 858 | Possibly. And also possibly not.
811 | 863 | 862 | Could be.
812 | 867 | 866 | Perhaps. Then again, perhaps not.
813 | 2115 | 2114 | Missing you already.
814 | 2193 | 2192 | Neat.
815 | 1965 | 1964 | Never.
816 | 899 | 898 | Never.
817 | 903 | 902 | All the time.
818 | 907 | 906 | Sometimes.
819 | 911 | 910 | Often.
820 | 915 | 914 | Occasionally.
821 | 919 | 918 | Hardly ever.
822 | 923 | 922 | When the mood's right.
823 | 935 | 934 | From time to time.
824 | 2189 | 2188 | Nice.
825 | 1031 | 1030 | Possibly. Let's give it a little time.
826 | 1037 | 1036 | Good to meet you too.
827 | 1041 | 1040 | The pleasure's all mine.
828 | 1697 | 1696 | No, dear.
829 | 779 | 778 | No.
830 | 823 | 822 | Not a hope.
831 | 827 | 826 | Nope.
832 | 783 | 782 | No no no no no no no!!!!
833 | 1607 | 1606 | No, dear.
834 | 1609 | 1608 | Well, no, I don't think so.
835 | 1611 | 1610 | Well, not really, dear.
836 | 1613 | 1612 | Well, no.
837 | 2277 | 2276 | No way.
838 | 787 | 786 | No.
839 | 839 | 838 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. No.
840 | 791 | 790 | No.
841 | 795 | 794 | No.
842 | 799 | 798 | No.
843 | 803 | 802 | No.
844 | 807 | 806 | No.
845 | 809 | 808 | No.
846 | 1469 | 1468 | The BarBot is a teeny weeny bit of a liar.
847 | 2081 | 2080 | I'm afraid that's not company policy.
848 | 1765 | 1764 | I'm sorry, I'd rather not talk about that dear.
849 | 2057 | 2056 | That's not what I heard.
850 | 1693 | 1692 | No doubt about it, dear.
851 | 1701 | 1700 | Don't worry about it dear.
852 | 1771 | 1770 | Oh dear.
853 | 1703 | 1702 | Oh dear, dear.
854 | 1711 | 1710 | Ok dear.
855 | 939 | 938 | I'm sure you're right.
856 | 943 | 942 | That might be a good thing to do and then again it might not.
857 | 947 | 946 | Absolutely.
858 | 951 | 950 | Without a doubt.
859 | 1861 | 1860 | Over there!
860 | 1865 | 1864 | Over there?
861 | 1889 | 1888 | It's a possibility.
862 | 2001 | 2000 | Possibly.
863 | 2005 | 2004 | Possibly not.
864 | 2033 | 2032 | Precisely.
865 | 1005 | 1004 | At the risk of repeating myself -
866 | 1009 | 1008 | I'll say it once and I'll say it again -
867 | 1013 | 1012 | If I've said it once I've said it a hundred times -
868 | 1017 | 1016 | Listen dear. Listen dear. Listen dear. Listen dear. Now dear, do you see what it's like?
869 | 1993 | 1992 | Probably.
870 | 1997 | 1996 | Probably not.
871 | 769 | 768 | Oh how sweet! You got another question right.
872 | 773 | 772 | Extraordinary. You got a question right.
873 | 1473 | 1472 | Do you have science on your planet dear? How terribly forward of you.
874 | 1479 | 1478 | Oh yes dear, I'm sure she's very good.
875 | 1477 | 1476 | Oh yes dear, I'm sure he's very good.
876 | 1723 | 1722 | Really?
877 | 995 | 994 | You're repeating yourself dear.
878 | 1001 | 1000 | You know dear, repeating a not terribly bright question does not increase its chances of being answered.
879 | 2201 | 2200 | Repugnant.
880 | 1877 | 1876 | Right here!
881 | 979 | 978 | Ah, good day. Marsinta here ready to do her best.
882 | 983 | 982 | Ahoy passenger! How can Marsinta help you today?.
883 | 987 | 986 | Yes, you can ring my bell any time.
884 | 991 | 990 | Yes? May I help you?
885 | 1949 | 1948 | You can say that again.
886 | 1969 | 1968 | Sometimes.
887 | 1495 | 1494 | Come on dear, speak up, you needn't be shy.
888 | 1497 | 1496 | You don't seem to have much to say for yourself, dear.
889 | 1499 | 1498 | Cat got your tongue, dear?
890 | 1501 | 1500 | What was that, dear, I missed it.
891 | 1251 | 1250 | but I'm not too sure.
892 | 1287 | 1286 | but I'm having a little trouble working out.
893 | 1255 | 1254 | but I'm not quite certain.
894 | 1259 | 1258 | but I can't quite absolutely recall.
895 | 1263 | 1262 | but I'm having a little trouble remembering.
896 | 1267 | 1266 | but it appears to have slipped my memory.
897 | 1271 | 1270 | but I'm not absolutely certain.
898 | 1275 | 1274 | but I can't say with absolute conviction.
899 | 1279 | 1278 | but I find it difficult to be sure.
900 | 1283 | 1282 | but I couldn't say with total certainty.
901 | 1213 | 1212 | , and I doubt you'll ever understand,
902 | 1247 | 1246 | , and I must say it's quite a rare event for me,
903 | 1217 | 1216 | , and I rather hope you won't take it personally,
904 | 1221 | 1220 | , and you certainly mustn't blame anyone for it,
905 | 1225 | 1224 | , and I'm quite prepared to take the blame myself for it,
906 | 1229 | 1228 | , and don't even think about blaming anyone,
907 | 1235 | 1234 | , and don't think it's got anything to do with you personally,
908 | 1239 | 1238 | , and I'd say this to any of the passengers,
909 | 1243 | 1242 | , and I must say it doesn't often happen to me,
910 | 1291 | 1290 | how.
911 | 1329 | 1328 | why you're going to do that.
912 | 1333 | 1332 | why you keep asking these not very bright questions.
913 | 1337 | 1336 | why you think that's relevant.
914 | 1341 | 1340 | why you persist in being not very bright.
915 | 1345 | 1344 | why you insist on acting in not a very bright manner.
916 | 1349 | 1348 | why you continue to act so strangely.
917 | 1353 | 1352 | who.
918 | 1357 | 1356 | who you mean.
919 | 1361 | 1360 | who did it.
920 | 1365 | 1364 | who moved it.
921 | 1295 | 1294 | how it works.
922 | 1369 | 1368 | who took it.
923 | 1373 | 1372 | who hid it.
924 | 1377 | 1376 | where.
925 | 1381 | 1380 | where it is.
926 | 1385 | 1384 | where they are.
927 | 1389 | 1388 | where it went.
928 | 1393 | 1392 | where they went.
929 | 1397 | 1396 | where it could be.
930 | 1401 | 1400 | where they could be.
931 | 1405 | 1404 | where he is.
932 | 1299 | 1298 | how you might solve that.
933 | 1409 | 1408 | where she is.
934 | 1413 | 1412 | when.
935 | 1417 | 1416 | when we're going to arrive.
936 | 1421 | 1420 | when that happened.
937 | 1425 | 1424 | when - if at all.
938 | 1429 | 1428 | when that'll happen.
939 | 1433 | 1432 | what.
940 | 1437 | 1436 | what that is.
941 | 1441 | 1440 | what you ought to do with it.
942 | 1445 | 1444 | what it does.
943 | 1305 | 1304 | how you might get that.
944 | 1449 | 1448 | what they do.
945 | 1453 | 1452 | what he does.
946 | 1457 | 1456 | what she does.
947 | 1461 | 1460 | what I mean any more.
948 | 1307 | 1306 | how you might get them.
949 | 1311 | 1310 | how you might go there.
950 | 1315 | 1314 | why.
951 | 1319 | 1318 | why that happens
952 | 1323 | 1322 | why you want to do that.
953 | 1325 | 1324 | why you think that.
954 | 1173 | 1172 | The thing is
955 | 1209 | 1208 | It distresses me deeply to have to say this
956 | 1177 | 1176 | The trouble is
957 | 1181 | 1180 | As it happens
958 | 1185 | 1184 | It's rather embarrassing
959 | 1189 | 1188 | I feel deeply ill at ease saying this
960 | 1193 | 1192 | The odd thing is
961 | 1197 | 1196 | The funny thing is
962 | 1201 | 1200 | This isn't logical
963 | 1205 | 1204 | This is something I never thought I'd say
964 | 1953 | 1952 | Stop it!
965 | 1659 | 1658 | Yes dear.
966 | 2233 | 2232 | Tell me less.
967 | 1957 | 1956 | Oh, yes, that's good.
968 | 2021 | 2020 | That's normal.
969 | 1925 | 1924 | That's amazing.
970 | 1921 | 1920 | That's good.
971 | 1689 | 1688 | That's right dear.
972 | 2129 | 2128 | The day after.
973 | 2125 | 2124 | The day before.
974 | 1857 | 1856 | There!
975 | 1653 | 1652 | Not to us, dear, not to us.
976 | 1893 | 1892 | Thought so.
977 | 2133 | 2132 | Hammerday.
978 | 2137 | 2136 | Rowday.
979 | 2141 | 2140 | Welday.
980 | 2145 | 2144 | Harday.
981 | 2149 | 2148 | Spryday.
982 | 2153 | 2152 | Otherday.
983 | 2157 | 2156 | Flatterday.
984 | 2161 | 2160 | Umph.
985 | 2121 | 2120 | Today is.
986 | 2181 | 2180 | Undoubtedly.
987 | 2065 | 2064 | Very good.
988 | 1465 | 1464 | Oh dear, you are out of your depth. Have you tried the Bar?
989 | 1575 | 1574 | I'm sure we'd all like to go home one day.
990 | 1065 | 1064 | You like weather? How charming.
991 | 1069 | 1068 | If you like weather - we've got a very wide selection on board.
992 | 1073 | 1072 | Look, if you like weather go up to the Arboretum - you can play with the weather till the clouds come home.
993 | 1719 | 1718 | What, dear?
994 | 955 | 954 | Blerontis is where the Starship Titanic was built.
995 | 1645 | 1644 | I'd rather not discuss the frogs, if you don't mind, dear.
996 | 2053 | 2052 | That's what I heard.
997 | 2217 | 2216 | What an idea.
998 | 1591 | 1590 | That's the Starship Titanic experience, dear, losing track of time.
999 | 1521 | 1520 | Titania is the most powerful ship's intelligence ever built. I could say more.
1000 | 1523 | 1522 | Leovinus designed Titania to run everything in the ship. All the systems and all the Bots. I could say more.
1001 | 1525 | 1524 | Since she's stopped working, all of us Bots are in a terribly confused state! I could go on.
1002 | 1527 | 1526 | If you could find a way of repairing her, you'd be doing everyone a very great favor! I could go on.
1003 | 1529 | 1528 | But I won't...
1004 | 1667 | 1666 | Metallic.
1005 | 895 | 894 | Sorry, can't tell you.
1006 | 2073 | 2072 | Well what a surprise.
1007 | 1561 | 1560 | She's lost her mind, dear.
1008 | 1989 | 1988 | What do you think?
1009 | 963 | 962 | Marsinta Drewbish at your service.
1010 | 1977 | 1976 | Whatever.
1011 | 2061 | 2060 | Whatever you say.
1012 | 1629 | 1628 | I don't know, dear. I really don't think you'll be needing them. Everything on this ship is very advanced, you know.
1013 | 1583 | 1582 | Well, dear, you could try a restaurant. That might do the trick.
1014 | 1587 | 1586 | Well, it depends what you like, dear. The Starship Titanic dining experience is available on floors.
1015 | 1881 | 1880 | I wouldn't know where to begin.
1016 | 1715 | 1714 | Why?
1017 | 1985 | 1984 | Why do you think?
1018 | 1685 | 1684 | Yes dear.
1019 | 677 | 676 | Oh yes!
1020 | 705 | 704 | You are so right, but then you always are.
1021 | 721 | 720 | Help yourself.
1022 | 725 | 724 | Right.
1023 | 729 | 728 | Yes indeed.
1024 | 733 | 732 | Well it certainly looks that way.
1025 | 737 | 736 | You'd better believe it.
1026 | 741 | 740 | Of course.
1027 | 745 | 744 | Go ahead.
1028 | 749 | 748 | Do what you want.
1029 | 753 | 752 | Definitely.
1030 | 757 | 756 | Not a doubt.
1031 | 761 | 760 | It's a sure thing.
1032 | 765 | 764 | Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. Yes.
1033 | 1603 | 1602 | Yes, dear.
1034 | 683 | 682 | Yes.
1035 | 2177 | 2176 | Yes, and what fun it is.
1036 | 2173 | 2172 | Yes, and what fun it was.
1037 | 1929 | 1928 | You're amazing.
1038 | 1945 | 1944 | You're really clever.
1039 | 1933 | 1932 | You're an idiot.
1040 | 1913 | 1912 | You reckon?
1041 | 2103 | 2102 | You're right.
1042 | 2107 | 2106 | You're wrong.
1043 | 3309 | 3308 | Affirmative.
1044 | 3823 | 3822 | All set?
1045 | 3819 | 3818 | So, you're all set?
1046 | 3501 | 3500 | Ow!
1047 | 3505 | 3504 | Ouch!
1048 | 3509 | 3508 | Hey, cut that out.
1049 | 3513 | 3512 | Stop it.
1050 | 3517 | 3516 | Excuse me, do you mind not doing that?
1051 | 3831 | 3830 | It's been real.
1052 | 3129 | 3128 | bit of brain
1053 | 3293 | 3292 | Chickens? You ask about chickens when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1054 | 3297 | 3296 | What? You ask about things like that when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1055 | 3233 | 3232 | Brobostigon.
1056 | 3937 | 3936 | Out of here
1057 | 3843 | 3842 | Well, can't just sit here shining.
1058 | 3577 | 3576 | The ship is controlled by a central intelligence. Maybe all the fuses are also kept in one place.
1059 | 3113 | 3112 | chicken
1060 | 4021 | 4020 | I see from this that you are clever, so I guess you won't need my help to find your room.
1061 | 3121 | 3120 | crushed tv set
1062 | 3269 | 3268 | D'Astragaar.
1063 | 3639 | 3638 | And here's your... Well, I would give it to you, but this is as far as you can go in the demo.

1119 | 3581 | 3580 | Maybe somebody took them for safe keeping?
1120 | 3289 | 3288 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Well, at least if we all die, the Parrot dies too!
1121 | 3915 | 3914 | You mean are they capable of being changed or are you capable of changing them? To the former, yes, to the second, in your dreams.
1122 | 3053 | 3052 | Oh dang. There go my settings again.
1123 | 2843 | 2842 | Well, you'll just have to deal with it. Maybe there are others who should deal with it, but I think they've been dealing with each other.
1124 | 3569 | 3568 | Well maybe it's blown a fuse.
1125 | 2823 | 2822 | My state of health is none of your concern, though I have to say I'm a little stressed by everybody rushing through my lobby in the last few hours.
1126 | 2827 | 2826 | Oh, Brobostigon, Scraliontis, Leovinus, everybody.
1127 | 3923 | 3922 | You first find out where they are, then you walk to where they are, then you stand in front of them, lean over and change them.
1128 | 3389 | 3388 | That girl needs to get her head together. You have to find all the bits.
1129 | 2941 | 2940 | I'm sure the LiftBot will get you there, if you can get a word in edgeways.
1130 | 2985 | 2984 | We are very, very lost indeed. So lost I don't think we'll ever be found again. And I can't help wonder why.
1131 | 3605 | 3604 | Old enough to be your mother. Now cut it out and get on.
1132 | 4003 | 4002 | Are you indeed? Well we shall see about that shan't we?
1133 | 2835 | 2834 | Big deal. I wish that I could say the same for some of the other people who've been through my lobby recently.
1134 | 2881 | 2880 | Fascinating. Do tell me less.
1135 | 3093 | 3092 | This is all just a game to you, isn't it? Here we all are in the last stages of mental disintegration, careering through space in an abandoned cruise ship, and you just want to play at puzzles!
1136 | 2889 | 2888 | Well, you didn't hear it from me, but first those two, Scraliontis and Brobostigon come on board with some so called filing cabinet. I could say more.
1137 | 3635 | 3634 | The Maitre D is just a tired old menu-driven has-been. His best is behind him.
1138 | 2851 | 2850 | Ah, what's your point?
1139 | 3887 | 3886 | What you think I'm some kind of gossip? Get outta here!
1140 | 4039 | 4038 | Oh yeah? Oh yeah? Oh YEAH? You go outside and say that!
1141 | 3101 | 3100 | Huh. You again. Did you find that
1142 | 3109 | 3108 | you were looking for earlier?
1143 | 3149 | 3148 | Huh you again. Did you find that thing you were looking for earlier?
1144 | 3157 | 3156 | Huh you again. Did you find that
1145 | 3165 | 3164 | you were looking for earlier?
1146 | 2949 | 2948 | Pluck my nostril hair, baby! Is that your job? No. Is carrying your bags my job? No. Is it the BellBot's job? Bingo! Hey, Krage! Come over here and pluck some nostril hair. Or carry bags. Or whatever.
1147 | 3029 | 3028 | Go there yourself. There's been enough running around on this ship. I'm going to stay here and mind my own business, and anyway I've been welded.
1148 | 3081 | 3080 | Last I heard it was. I'm the DeskBot and nobody's sacked me yet.
1149 | 3907 | 3906 | They are the things that determine exactly how each of the different Bots behaves, which in my opinion, is uniformly badly.
1150 | 3073 | 3072 | Well far be it from me to say that which should not be said, but seeing as you're probably too dimwitted to understand, there's probably no harm in saying that my niceness is set to low and my gossipiness is set to high. So what's wrong with that? Nothing.
1151 | 3001 | 3000 | I wouldn't hold out much hope about that. How many lawyers you got?
1152 | 3003 | 3002 | We got more. How big are yours?
1153 | 3005 | 3004 | Ours are bigger.
1154 | 2861 | 2860 | I think about what I see.
1155 | 2863 | 2862 | People. Things. Parrots. Whatever. Even bombs sometimes. I mean, I don't like to pry, but when I see a bomb I think, 'Hmm. There's a bomb'.
1156 | 3589 | 3588 | Just a fancy elevator.
1157 | 2859 | 2858 | I am the DeskBot. I sit here. When I'm not being bothered by damn passengers, I watch and I think.
1158 | 3625 | 3624 | He's so precious about his damn music, his damn menu, his damn fencing etiquette. Let me give you a bit of advice. Just go back up there and kick ass.
1159 | 3985 | 3984 | Well, I've often wondered that myself, and if you find out perhaps you'd tell me.
1160 | 3993 | 3992 | That no good filthy creature hasn't got any cellpoint settings. Don't you think if it did have somebody would have changed them long ago? Preferably to dead!
1161 | 3999 | 3998 | You think a primitive bit of mechanical flatulence needs cellpoint settings? It hasn't got any, dumbo.
1162 | 2993 | 2992 | She's lost her mind. Literally. Or should I say it's been lost for her. Taken apart and lost. That's just my guess, of course, but why else was everyone running around the ship last night?
1163 | 3891 | 3890 | I don't see that it's any of your business, but they are niceness and gossipiness.
1164 | 3899 | 3898 | Mind you own business you appalling busybody, I have no intention of telling you, though if I had you'd learn that my niceness as low and my gossipiness was high soon enough.
1165 | 3213 | 3212 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the desk.
1166 | 3221 | 3220 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the door.
1167 | 3197 | 3196 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the Succ-U-Bus.
1168 | 3205 | 3204 | It's just what it looks like. It's just the wall.
1169 | 3667 | 3666 | See if you can figure it out. It's a Lobby. It's the one you embarked into. Hence, Embarkation Lobby. Seems pretty quiet now, but you should have seen who was coming and going last night.
1170 | 3931 | 3930 | Well, they're not in here, they're not in the Parrot Lobby, they're not in the Creators Chamber, so that means they must be in the Sculpture Chamber, doesn't it.
1171 | 2901 | 2900 | Blerontis. And since we're relying on you to save us here, I don't expect I'll be seeing it again.
1172 | 3675 | 3674 | Zark knows. Doing something stupid and irritating I expect. BellBot!
1173 | 2977 | 2976 | Behind us. And since our only chance of fixing the ship and finding it again is you I expect it will remain behind us.
1174 | 2867 | 2866 | How should I know. I just sit here. I observe. But I can only observe what's in here, seeing as I'm welded to the spot.
1175 | 3981 | 3980 | Go out of here, trying not to look as furtive as Brobostigon and Scraliontis did last night when they went through here, give the Parrot lobby the widest possible berth if I were you, go past the Top of the Well and you'll find it opposite the Sculpture Chamber.
1176 | 4009 | 4008 | and you will also find that you can't get in without an upgrade to second class.
1177 | 3683 | 3682 | Zark knows. Doing something stupid and irritating I expect. Hey! DoorBot!
1178 | 3701 | 3700 | At the Top of the Well. If they're functioning. You heard of going to hell in a handcart? Ever wonder what a handcart is? This is a handcart. A big glossy handcart.
1179 | 2969 | 2968 | Vastan. At least that's where we were heading till your stupid house got in the way. Now, who knows?
1180 | 3013 | 3012 | The ship that couldn't possibly go wrong went wrong before it could even pick up any. Ha!
1181 | 3021 | 3020 | The BarBot's in the Bar. And he's screwed to the floor, I'm glad to report.
1182 | 3691 | 3690 | The LiftBot is to be found in all four of the elevators. If you've been looking for an opportunity to discuss rare and unpleasant wars and skin conditions, now's your chance.
1183 | 2957 | 2956 | And what exactly were you going to do on one of those? No, don't tell me. I don't want bathroom talk in my lobby. You don't need one.
1184 | 2961 | 2960 | Then wait till you get back to your own world!
1185 | 3041 | 3040 | Who built everything? Mr. Smarty-pants Leovinus. Is he as clever as he thinks he is? I wonder.
1186 | 2865 | 2864 | Who do you think? Scraliontis and Brobostigon.
1187 | 3713 | 3712 | Your upgrade includes an improved model of the PET.
1188 | 3835 | 3834 | Gotta go.
1189 | 3839 | 3838 | Gotta run.
1190 | 3141 | 3140 | hammer
1191 | 3811 | 3810 | Hmmm.
1192 | 3181 | 3180 | Hmmm...
1193 | 3065 | 3064 | Go ask the DoorBot. Or the BellBot.
1194 | 3441 | 3440 | I just don't know - and I don't suppose you do either.
1195 | 3445 | 3444 | I've racked my brain all the way from Blerontis, but I just don't know the answer.
1196 | 3393 | 3392 | You have to find all the bits. She still needs her
1197 | 3417 | 3416 | Auditory Center.

1208 | 3549 | 3548 | Change to Designer Room Number mode in the PET, and then drag the code for the room you want.
1209 | 3545 | 3544 | You put an object in the tray, use your PET to give the succubus the chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. The sir, madam or thing at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops, fresh as a doozy.
1210 | 3557 | 3556 | Pop into the Real World mode in your PET and I'm sure you'll see the option you seek.
1211 | 3553 | 3552 | Select the Personal Baggage mode in your PET, and then drag the thing into it.
1212 | 3561 | 3560 | Use the PET Remote Thingummy mode. Choose the thing you want to control, and then... control it.
1213 | 3305 | 3304 | Immediately.
1214 | 3461 | 3460 | Immediately.
1215 | 4027 | 4026 | It's a desk... It's my desk.
1216 | 3321 | 3320 | It's right behind you.
1217 | 3317 | 3316 | It's right here.
1218 | 3481 | 3480 | Just missed it.
1219 | 3253 | 3252 | Krage.
1220 | 3807 | 3806 | Well, lah di dah.
1221 | 3277 | 3276 | Drewbish.
1222 | 3473 | 3472 | Later.
1223 | 4017 | 4016 | I see from this that you are lazy, so I'll try to keep it quick.

1227 | 3265 | 3264 | Marsinta.
1228 | 3245 | 3244 | Me.
1229 | 3281 | 3280 | I haven't got a middle name. Never saw the need.
1230 | 3485 | 3484 | If you hurry you might just make it.
1231 | 3847 | 3846 | Huh, modern technology.
1232 | 3313 | 3312 | It would not be my pleasure.
1233 | 3457 | 3456 | Never.
1234 | 2661 | 2660 | Welcome guest number... er, one, to the most glamorous galactic cruiseship experience in the whole of the space-time continuum, the Starship Titanic, the ship that cannot possibly go wrong. Ha! My name's Drewbish, Marsinta Drewbish. I am the DeskBot. Do you have a reservation?
1235 | 2663 | 2662 | I very much doubt it! Name?
1236 | 2673 | 2672 | Wrong! But I see that Fentible thinks we should take you on board anyway. Softhearted fool. I don't see that you're going to be of any help. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1237 | 2665 | 2664 | Hmmm, we do seem to have someone of that name here. Probably just a coincidence. A bit of a frog fancier. Of course, we only use that information for blackmail purposes. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1238 | 2671 | 2670 | Hmmm, we seem to have someone of that name here. But it's a very popular name, so as far as I'm concerned your just a freeloader. Ah well.
1239 | 2667 | 2666 | Hmmm, we do seem to have someone of that name here. Probably just a coincidence. A bit of a
1240 | 2669 | 2668 | fancier. Of course, we only use that information for blackmail purposes. As far as I'm concerned you're just a freeloader. Ah well.
1241 | 2679 | 2678 | You've been assigned to a Super Galactic Traveler Class room. Don't get your hopes up. There's your room number.
1242 | 2681 | 2680 | Good luck!
1243 | 2813 | 2812 | Any questions?
1244 | 2815 | 2814 | Ask the BellBot.
1245 | 2675 | 2674 | I thought not! But I see that Fentible thinks we should take you on board. Huh, softhearted fool. I don't see that you're going to be any help. As far as I'm concerned your just a freeloader. Ah well.
1246 | 2677 | 2676 | Better get you checked in.
1247 | 2923 | 2922 | It's next to Elevator 1.
1248 | 2925 | 2924 | It's next to Elevator 2.
1249 | 2927 | 2926 | It's next to Elevator 3.
1250 | 2929 | 2928 | It's next to Elevator 4.
1251 | 2933 | 2932 | What's your problem? Are you innumerate?
1252 | 2659 | 2658 | NOT YET, NOT YET !
1253 | 3377 | 3376 | Oh, sorry.
1254 | 3381 | 3380 | I'm most dreadfully sorry.
1255 | 3791 | 3790 | OK.
1256 | 3873 | 3872 | Ouch.
1257 | 3875 | 3874 | Ouch that hurt.
1258 | 3877 | 3876 | Don't do that.
1259 | 3879 | 3878 | I said don't do that.
1260 | 3881 | 3880 | I will not be prodded!
1261 | 3883 | 3882 | Prod off!
1262 | 4059 | 4058 | I don't believe in all that kind of stuff. Aliens? Ha, give me a break.
1263 | 4071 | 4070 | I don't dance I'm afraid. It's a bit hard when you're welded to the furniture.
1264 | 4067 | 4066 | I'm afraid we don't do product placement on this ship.
1265 | 4063 | 4062 | If you're a music fan, maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the music room.
1266 | 4075 | 4074 | So you can talk the talk. Can you walk the walk? I'd like to see you navigate a ship like this!
1267 | 4043 | 4042 | Science? What has science ever done for anybody? Who needs talking desklamps anyway?
1268 | 4047 | 4046 | What did he do, invent the wheel? What's wrong with a nice triangle, that's what I want to know.
1269 | 4031 | 4030 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
1270 | 4051 | 4050 | Is that someone you met hanging round the water cooler?
1271 | 4055 | 4054 | Call that a book? It's just a pack of lies written by some oversexed Welsh parrot!
1272 | 3301 | 3300 | Right away.
1273 | 3465 | 3464 | Right away.

1294 | 3169 | 3168 | Huh...
1295 | 3185 | 3184 | Atchoo...
1296 | 3189 | 3188 | Atchoo...
1297 | 3855 | 3854 | So what?
1298 | 3469 | 3468 | Soon.
1299 | 3521 | 3520 | Sorry?
1300 | 3525 | 3524 | Speak up.
1301 | 3529 | 3528 | Could you repeat that please, I didn't hear you.
1302 | 3533 | 3532 | Huh?.
1303 | 3537 | 3536 | Space, the final frontier.
1304 | 4015 | 4014 | I see from this that you are stupid, so I'll try to keep it simple.
1305 | 4019 | 4018 | I see from this that you are stupid and lazy, so I guess I'll be seeing a lot of you.
1306 | 4023 | 4022 | I see from this that you are stupid and lazy, so you'll no doubt get on well with the BellBot.
1307 | 3795 | 3794 | Sure.
1308 | 3799 | 3798 | Sure thing.
1309 | 3285 | 3284 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Be careful!
1310 | 3913 | 3912 | Maybe.
1311 | 3049 | 3048 | Oh dang. There go my settings again.
1312 | 2839 | 2838 | Get over it.
1313 | 3565 | 3564 | Well maybe it's blown a fuse.
1314 | 2819 | 2818 | None of your business.
1315 | 3921 | 3920 | First you find them, then you change them.
1316 | 3385 | 3384 | That girl needs to get her head together. You have to find all the bits.
1317 | 2937 | 2936 | Jump. Or you could ask a LiftBot.
1318 | 2981 | 2980 | We're deep in interstellar space with no navigation. How lost does that sound?
1319 | 3601 | 3600 | Too old for you, dear.
1320 | 4001 | 4000 | I'm not surprised.
1321 | 2831 | 2830 | Oh good.
1322 | 2877 | 2876 | Fascinating.
1323 | 3089 | 3088 | Yeah. What exactly are you doing here?
1324 | 2885 | 2884 | Mind your own damn business.
1325 | 2893 | 2892 | Then a while later, Leovinus himself came aboard. That's all I saw. There was a lot of noise later on, but I couldn't hear. That's all.
1326 | 3631 | 3630 | Oh, just humor him. He's a stupid, weak man.
1327 | 2847 | 2846 | Uh huh.
1328 | 3659 | 3658 | I do wish they wouldn't do this! It's very bad for passenger discipline! Oh very well, let me see.
1329 | 4037 | 4036 | Same to you with knobs on.
1330 | 3097 | 3096 | Did you find that
1331 | 3105 | 3104 | you were looking for earlier?
1332 | 3145 | 3144 | Ah, I see you found that thing you were after.
1333 | 3153 | 3152 | Ah, I see you found that
1334 | 3161 | 3160 | you were after.
1335 | 2945 | 2944 | You think I'm a BellBot?
1336 | 3025 | 3024 | Go there yourself. I'm staying here. I'm welded.
1337 | 3077 | 3076 | You got it.
1338 | 3905 | 3904 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots.
1339 | 3069 | 3068 | My niceness is set to low and my gossipiness is set to low. Deal with it.
1340 | 2997 | 2996 | Nothing.
1341 | 3585 | 3584 | Just a fancy elevator.
1342 | 2855 | 2854 | I am the DeskBot.
1343 | 3621 | 3620 | How long have you got?
1344 | 3627 | 3626 | Not enough.
1345 | 3983 | 3982 | Ask 'em yourself.
1346 | 3991 | 3990 | They're too primitive to have any.
1347 | 2989 | 2988 | She's lost her mind. Literally. Or should I say it's been lost for her. Taken apart and lost.
1348 | 3889 | 3888 | Niceness and gossipiness.
1349 | 3897 | 3896 | My niceness is low and so is my gossipiness. Punk.
1350 | 3209 | 3208 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A desk.
1351 | 3217 | 3216 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A door.
1352 | 3193 | 3192 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A Suc-U-Bus.
1353 | 3201 | 3200 | Mind your own business. Search me. No idea. A wall.
1354 | 3663 | 3662 | Embarkation Lobby!
1355 | 3929 | 3928 | In the Sculpture Chamber.
1356 | 2897 | 2896 | Blerontis. What's it to you?
1357 | 3671 | 3670 | BellBot!
1358 | 2973 | 2972 | Behind us.
1359 | 3679 | 3678 | DoorBot!
1360 | 3697 | 3696 | At the Top of the Well.
1361 | 2965 | 2964 | Vastan.
1362 | 3009 | 3008 | Biggest cruise ship ever. No passengers. Stupid eh? Ha!
1363 | 3017 | 3016 | The BarBot's in the Bar.
1364 | 3687 | 3686 | The LiftBot is to be found in all four of the elevators.
1365 | 2953 | 2952 | There aren't any. The designers forgot. You'll just have to cross your legs.
1366 | 3037 | 3036 | Leovinus, of course.
1367 | 3709 | 3708 | Did you breathe on it? Don't answer that.
1368 | 3333 | 3332 | Thank you.
1369 | 3337 | 3336 | All in a day's work.
1370 | 3341 | 3340 | My pleasure.
1371 | 3345 | 3344 | Glad to help.
1372 | 3349 | 3348 | If there's anything else I can do to help, please hesitate to ask.
1373 | 3241 | 3240 | The Gat.
1374 | 3827 | 3826 | Well, there you go.
1375 | 3133 | 3132 | thing
1376 | 3617 | 3616 | Super Galactic Traveler Class. That means riff raff.
1377 | 3225 | 3224 | Titania.
1378 | 3497 | 3496 | Try the bar.
1379 | 3493 | 3492 | Try the Restaurant.
1380 | 3787 | 3786 | Uh huh.
1381 | 3173 | 3172 | Ummm...
1382 | 3353 | 3352 | Up and down.
1383 | 3641 | 3640 | I've assigned you to a Second Class Stateroom,
1384 | 3643 | 3642 | which you will reach by
1385 | 3645 | 3644 | Don't get drunk in the bar, don't annoy the musicians, don't fiddle with the Pellerator, don't touch the artwork, and if you go up to the promenade deck don't scuff the woodwork! There you are. And it's better than you deserve.
1386 | 3325 | 3324 | We're already there.
1387 | 3061 | 3060 | They control my mood. The DoorBot knows more about how it works than I do.
1388 | 3369 | 3368 | Oh, things.
1389 | 3033 | 3032 | A wall.
1390 | 3541 | 3540 | You'll need to use your code to find your stateroom. You can also drag codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something, or to tell an Elevator or Pellerator where to take you.
1391 | 3085 | 3084 | Check in. What do you think? Some people ask for upgrades. Nobody gets one.
1392 | 3705 | 3704 | I thought you were on board to help figure out what's wrong with the ship, or are you just going to wander round poking your nose into rooms that are nothing to do with you, picking up anything that isn't nailed down and bleating for the DoorBot or BellBot whenever you get stuck?
1393 | 3803 | 3802 | So what's new?
1394 | 3057 | 3056 | My Cellpoint settings.
1395 | 3373 | 3372 | Some stuff I had to do.
1396 | 3863 | 3862 | Whatever.
1397 | 3449 | 3448 | Too late.
1398 | 3453 | 3452 | It's 'now'. You'd better hurry before it's 'too late'.
1399 | 3489 | 3488 | Whenever you like.
1400 | 3573 | 3572 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1401 | 2905 | 2904 | It's recorded in your PET.
1402 | 2913 | 2912 | It's better than you deserve.
1403 | 2907 | 2906 | via
1404 | 3941 | 3940 | turn left
1405 | 3945 | 3944 | turn right
1406 | 3949 | 3948 | past the Top of the Well
1407 | 3953 | 3952 | past the Top of the Well and on your left
1408 | 3957 | 3956 | past the Top of the Well and on your right
1409 | 3961 | 3960 | Go out of here, give the Parrot lobby the widest possible birth, go past the Top of the Well and you'll find it opposite the Creators Chamber
1410 | 3965 | 3964 | and straight ahead
1411 | 3971 | 3970 | Out of here, straight ahead, turn right, past the Top of the Well, and on your right.
1412 | 3975 | 3974 | Out of here, straight ahead, turn left, past the Top of the Well, and on your left.
1413 | 3979 | 3978 | But without an upgrade to Second, you won't get in.
1414 | 3357 | 3356 | Round and about.
1415 | 3361 | 3360 | Here and there.
1416 | 3365 | 3364 | This and that.
1417 | 3045 | 3044 | Starlight Lines.
1418 | 4013 | 4012 | You know I won an award once? Yeah, employee of the month. What a month that was. You can just imagine!
1419 | 3249 | 3248 | You.
1420 | 3815 | 3814 | So, you're all set.
1421 | 3859 | 3858 | You got it.
1422 | 3593 | 3592 | Yes.
1423 | 3597 | 3596 | No.
1424 | 3329 | 3328 | You're standing in it.
1425 | 3307 | 3306 | Affirmative.
1426 | 3821 | 3820 | All set?
1427 | 3753 | 3752 | my little amuse bouche.
1428 | 3731 | 3730 | angel.
1429 | 3733 | 3732 | angelheart.
1430 | 3817 | 3816 | So, you're all set?
1431 | 3499 | 3498 | Ow!
1432 | 3503 | 3502 | Ouch!
1433 | 3507 | 3506 | Hey, cut that out.
1434 | 3511 | 3510 | Stop it.
1435 | 3515 | 3514 | Excuse me, do you mind not doing that?
1436 | 3829 | 3828 | It's been real.
1437 | 3127 | 3126 | bit of brain
1438 | 3291 | 3290 | Chickens? You ask about chickens when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1439 | 3295 | 3294 | What dear? You ask a thing like that when there's a bomb about to go off?!
1440 | 3767 | 3766 | booblywooblykins.
1441 | 3231 | 3230 | Brobostigon.
1442 | 3757 | 3756 | bunny rabbit.
1443 | 3841 | 3840 | Well, can't just sit here shining.
1444 | 3575 | 3574 | The ship is controlled by a central intelligence. Maybe all the fuses are also kept in one place.
1445 | 3745 | 3744 | my little cauliflower.
1446 | 3717 | 3716 | cherub.
1447 | 3111 | 3110 | chicken

1449 | 3119 | 3118 | crushed tv set
1450 | 3723 | 3722 | my darling munchkin.
1451 | 3267 | 3266 | D'Astragaar.
1452 | 3637 | 3636 | And here's your... Well, I would give it to you, but this is as far as you can go in the demo.
1453 | 3475 | 3474 | Earlier.
1454 | 3747 | 3746 | my little glass of elderberry cordial.
1455 | 3175 | 3174 | Ohhh...
1456 | 3849 | 3848 | Fascinating.
1457 | 3259 | 3258 | Fentible.
1458 | 3607 | 3606 | First Class.
1459 | 3271 | 3270 | Marsinta.

1461 | 3255 | 3254 | Fortillian.
1462 | 3579 | 3578 | Maybe somebody took them for safe keeping?
1463 | 3287 | 3286 | I hear that thing is a bomb! I hope we're not all going to die, dear!
1464 | 3919 | 3918 | If anybody can, dear heart, I'm sure you can.
1465 | 3051 | 3050 | Whoops! There go my settings again. I wonder how things will turn out now?
1466 | 2841 | 2840 | Oh dear, I feel so bad about your house. I know who ought to be able to help you, but I don't know what's happened to them.
1467 | 3567 | 3566 | Perhaps it has blown a fuse, dear?
1468 | 2821 | 2820 | I'm fine, dearikins, which is more than can be said for some of the people who've been through this lobby in the last few hours.
1469 | 2825 | 2824 | Oh, Brobostigon, Scraliontis, Leovinus, everybody.
1470 | 3927 | 3926 | Oh, it's really terribly easy, I believe, dear, you just pull the levers on the cellpoints.
1471 | 3387 | 3386 | You'll have to help her get her head together.
1472 | 2939 | 2938 | I'm sure the LiftBot will be very happy to assist you, my poppet.
1473 | 2983 | 2982 | Very lost, dear. There's no means of knowing where we are at all.
1474 | 3603 | 3602 | As young as spring time. Which reminds me. Have you been to the Arboretum yet? They have a very nice spring there? And a nice fall as well.
1475 | 4007 | 4006 | Well, if you think that's wise, dear. I always like a little adventure of course, but it doesn't always turn out well, does it?
1476 | 2833 | 2832 | I'm very glad to hear that, dear. I wish that I could say the same for some of the other people who've been through my lobby recently.
1477 | 2879 | 2878 | Fascinating, dear. Do tell me more.
1478 | 3091 | 3090 | Well, sometimes the Succ-U-Bus is a bit of a puzzle to me. Is that the sort of thing you meant, sweetheart?
1479 | 2887 | 2886 | Well, it's really not my business to say, but first Scraliontis and Brobostigon came aboard with this kind of filing cabinet thing. I could say more!
1480 | 3633 | 3632 | Well the Maitre D does have a weakness, but he says that it's behind him now.
1481 | 2849 | 2848 | And you. Very nice. Very nice indeed.
1482 | 3885 | 3884 | Oh, I couldn't possibly say. I'm not a gossip, dear.
1483 | 4035 | 4034 | Now, I know you're upset about something, but sharp words will cut your mouth, dear.
1484 | 3099 | 3098 | Ah there you are. Did you find that
1485 | 3107 | 3106 | you were looking for earlier?
1486 | 3147 | 3146 | Ah there you are, dear. Did you find that thing you were looking for earlier?
1487 | 3155 | 3154 | Ah there you are, dear.. Did you find that
1488 | 3163 | 3162 | you were looking for earlier?
1489 | 2947 | 2946 | That's the BellBot's job, dear. I'll just see if he's around. Oh Krage!
1490 | 3027 | 3026 | I wish I could, but a welded Bot got to stay where a welded Bot's been welded.
1491 | 3079 | 3078 | That's right, and I'm the one who does it.
1492 | 3653 | 3652 | I've assigned you to a First Class Stateroom
1493 | 3655 | 3654 | which you will reach by
1494 | 3657 | 3656 | Oh, you're going to love First Class, beautiful rooms, none of those nasty lavatory things, there's the lovely Restaurant, the Canal with the lovely RowBot who sings for you, such a lovely voice, the Arboretum for when you want to commune with nature a little, there you are. It's lovely in the Arboretum at this time of year. And if you don't agree, you can always select the time of year of your choice.
1495 | 2869 | 2868 | Do you think so, dear? I think it may just have been a filing cabinet.
1496 | 3911 | 3910 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots, cherub.
1497 | 3071 | 3070 | Well, dear, I don't know if I should really be saying this, but since it is you I will just mention that my niceness is set to high and my gossipiness is set to high, dear.
1498 | 2999 | 2998 | Well, I wish I could offer you any comfort on that score dear, but I've never known anybody sue the company successfully.
1499 | 3587 | 3586 | It's a kind of elevator only more complicated.
1500 | 2857 | 2856 | I am the DeskBot, dear. I sit here all day, I attend to passengers' needs and I... well, I see a lot of comings and goings. I try not to notice of course, but sometimes it's hard.
1501 | 3623 | 3622 | He says it's behind him, honeypie, and I'm sure he's right.
1502 | 3989 | 3988 | Oh, that's not the sort of thing we really know about each other, though I won't pretend we don't try to guess sometimes! But I think you'll have to ask them yourself, dear.
1503 | 3997 | 3996 | I don't think it has any, really, dear. Too rudimentary.
1504 | 2991 | 2990 | She's lost her mind, dear. Or it's been lost for her. Or misplaced, I should say. I think that there's been a lot of very naughty running around here. All over the place they were last night.
1505 | 3895 | 3894 | Well, that's rather a personal question, dear, but seeing as it's you, I'll tell you that they are niceness and gossipiness.
1506 | 3903 | 3902 | Oh, well I don't know if I should really say, but since my gossipiness is currently high - oh dear, I've let that out haven't I? - I suppose you won't be surprised to learn that my niceness is high dear.
1507 | 3211 | 3210 | Well, I think that's just the desk.
1508 | 3219 | 3218 | Well, I think that's just the door.
1509 | 3195 | 3194 | Well, I think that's just the Succ-U-Bus.
1510 | 3203 | 3202 | Well, I think that's just the wall.
1511 | 3665 | 3664 | This is the Embarkation Lobby, dear, which is where I ply my trade. It looks pretty empty now, but last night there were all sorts of people coming through it!
1512 | 3935 | 3934 | They're all rather fetchingly displayed around the Sculpture Chamber, heart.
1513 | 2899 | 2898 | Blerontis, dear. Such a nice place. You should visit if you get the chance. That's if you manage to fix the ship.
1514 | 3673 | 3672 | Oh, expect he's rummaging around somewhere, you never can tell with those boys. I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Krage!
1515 | 2975 | 2974 | Behind us, dear. I do hope we will get back there one day, but first we need you to fix the ship.
1516 | 2873 | 2872 | I've no idea, sweetness. It was probably nothing anyway.
1517 | 3681 | 3680 | Oh, expect he's rummaging around somewhere, you never can tell with those boys. I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Fentible!
1518 | 3699 | 3698 | At the Top of the Well, but I don't know what sort of state the elevators are in. I heard a lot of banging around. Be careful which one you take, dear.
1519 | 2967 | 2966 | We were heading for Vastan. Now we're lost, and will probably remain lost until you manage to fix the ship for us.
1520 | 3011 | 3010 | We never got as far as Vastan, dear, where we were supposed to pick up the passengers.
1521 | 3019 | 3018 | The BarBot's in the Bar. Old charmer that he is.
1522 | 3689 | 3688 | Nobby is in four of the elevators, dear. You'll enjoy him, if you like talking about the war an awful lot.
1523 | 3693 | 3692 | That's a very good question, dear. None of us have been able to figure it out.
1524 | 2955 | 2954 | We find that most of our first and second class passengers have transcended the need for such things. Let's not talk about it dear.
1525 | 3039 | 3038 | Why, Leovinus of course, who else?
1526 | 2871 | 2870 | Scraliontis and Brobostigon. They just wheeled it through. Probably quite innocent.
1527 | 3711 | 3710 | To reflect your enhanced status, my sweetheart. It's just a little thing we like to do. Nice, don't you think?
1528 | 3759 | 3758 | my sweet little gerbil.
1529 | 3833 | 3832 | Gotta go.
1530 | 3837 | 3836 | Gotta run.
1531 | 3139 | 3138 | hammer
1532 | 3761 | 3760 | my little harvest mouse.
1533 | 3765 | 3764 | heart.
1534 | 3809 | 3808 | Hmmm.
1535 | 3179 | 3178 | Arghh...
1536 | 3063 | 3062 | You'd better ask the DoorBot. Or the BellBot.
1537 | 3439 | 3438 | I just don't know - I'm sure you'll think of something, dear.
1538 | 3443 | 3442 | I've racked my brain all the way from Blerontis, but I just don't know the answer.
1539 | 3391 | 3390 | She still needs her
1540 | 3415 | 3414 | Auditory Center.
1541 | 3431 | 3430 | Central Intelligence Core.

1550 | 3435 | 3434 | Vision Center.
1551 | 3547 | 3546 | Change to Designer Room Number mode in the PET, and then drag the code for the room you want.
1552 | 3543 | 3542 | You put an object in the tray, use your PET to give the succubus the chevron code for the room you want to send it to, and off it goes. The sir, madam or thing at the other end then presses their receive button and out it pops, fresh as a doozy.
1553 | 3555 | 3554 | Pop into the Real World mode in your PET and I'm sure you'll see the option you seek.
1554 | 3551 | 3550 | Select the Personal Baggage mode in your PET, and then drag the thing into it.
1555 | 3559 | 3558 | Use the PET Remote Thingummy mode. Choose the thing you want to control, and then... control it.
1556 | 3783 | 3782 | I'm sorry
1557 | 3303 | 3302 | Immediately.
1558 | 3459 | 3458 | Immediately.
1559 | 4025 | 4024 | It's a desk... It's my desk.
1560 | 3319 | 3318 | It's right behind you.
1561 | 3315 | 3314 | It's right here.
1562 | 3479 | 3478 | Just missed it.
1563 | 3251 | 3250 | Krage.
1564 | 3805 | 3804 | Well, lah di dah.
1565 | 3275 | 3274 | Drewbish.
1566 | 3471 | 3470 | Later.
1567 | 3115 | 3114 | lemon
1568 | 3227 | 3226 | Leovinus.
1569 | 3773 | 3772 | my little chicken.
1570 | 3771 | 3770 | my little lemon.
1571 | 3775 | 3774 | my little starling.
1572 | 3135 | 3134 | long stick
1573 | 3721 | 3720 | my little love-bucket.
1574 | 3715 | 3714 | lovey.
1575 | 3719 | 3718 | loveykins.
1576 | 3739 | 3738 | loveykins.
1577 | 3779 | 3778 | lusciouskins.
1578 | 3263 | 3262 | Marsinta.
1579 | 3243 | 3242 | Me.
1580 | 3279 | 3278 | I haven't got a middle name. Never saw the need.
1581 | 3483 | 3482 | If you hurry you might just make it.
1582 | 3845 | 3844 | Huh, modern technology.
1583 | 3311 | 3310 | It would be my pleasure.
1584 | 3455 | 3454 | Never.
1585 | 2915 | 2914 | It's next to Elevator 1 dear.
1586 | 2917 | 2916 | It's next to Elevator 2 dear.
1587 | 2919 | 2918 | It's next to Elevator 3 dear.
1588 | 2921 | 2920 | It's next to Elevator 4 dear.
1589 | 2931 | 2930 | Is that helpful? Is that what you're asking?
1590 | 3375 | 3374 | Oh, sorry.
1591 | 3379 | 3378 | I'm most dreadfully sorry.
1592 | 3789 | 3788 | OK.
1593 | 3737 | 3736 | poppety.
1594 | 3735 | 3734 | poppetykins.
1595 | 3769 | 3768 | poppetywoppetytitmouse.
1596 | 3865 | 3864 | Please don't do that.
1597 | 3867 | 3866 | I'd rather you didn't do that dear.
1598 | 3869 | 3868 | I'd really rather you didn't do that.
1599 | 3871 | 3870 | Please dear, if you keep doing that, I can't answer for the consequences.
1600 | 3741 | 3740 | my little pumpkin.
1601 | 3743 | 3742 | pussycat.
1602 | 4057 | 4056 | Well, there's certainly something strange going on somewhere, isn't there? I know there is on this ship.
1603 | 4069 | 4068 | I don't dance I'm afraid. It's a bit hard when you're welded to the furniture.
1604 | 4065 | 4064 | I'm afraid we don't do product placement on this ship.
1605 | 4061 | 4060 | If you're a music fan, maybe you should try and introduce a little harmony into the music room.
1606 | 4073 | 4072 | Very impressive dear. Do you think you'll be able to navigate the ship?
1607 | 4041 | 4040 | I don't hold with all that science, dear. I prefer to believe complete nonsense. It's much more comforting, don't you think?
1608 | 4045 | 4044 | Oh, he's one of your clever-cloggies is he? I don't believe in straining the brain dear. Just wears it out.
1609 | 4029 | 4028 | I'm dawdling as quickly as I can.
1610 | 4049 | 4048 | Is that someone you met hanging round the water cooler?
1611 | 4053 | 4052 | You don't want to pay any attention to that book, dear, it's all made up. Complete fabrication.
1612 | 3749 | 3748 | my little raspberry souffl$.
1613 | 3299 | 3298 | Right away.
1614 | 3463 | 3462 | Right away.
1615 | 3235 | 3234 | Scraliontis.
1616 | 3611 | 3610 | Second Class.
1617 | 3167 | 3166 | Harrrr...
1618 | 3183 | 3182 | Atchoo...
1619 | 3187 | 3186 | Atchoo...
1620 | 3853 | 3852 | So what?
1621 | 3467 | 3466 | Soon.
1622 | 3519 | 3518 | Sorry?
1623 | 3523 | 3522 | Speak up.
1624 | 3527 | 3526 | Could you repeat that please, I didn't hear you.
1625 | 3531 | 3530 | Huh?.
1626 | 3535 | 3534 | Space, the final frontier.
1627 | 3777 | 3776 | sugarplum.
1628 | 3755 | 3754 | my little sunflower seed.
1629 | 3793 | 3792 | Sure.
1630 | 3797 | 3796 | Sure thing.
1631 | 3725 | 3724 | sweetheart.
1632 | 3727 | 3726 | sweetie.
1633 | 3729 | 3728 | sweetiepie.
1634 | 3283 | 3282 | I hear that thing is a bomb! Do be careful, dear!
1635 | 3917 | 3916 | I'm sure you can, lovey-dovey.
1636 | 3047 | 3046 | Whoops! There go my settings again!
1637 | 2837 | 2836 | Oh dear, dear, I'm so sorry.
1638 | 3563 | 3562 | Perhaps it has blown a fuse?
1639 | 2817 | 2816 | I'm fine dear. How are you?
1640 | 3925 | 3924 | It's very easy, you just pull the levers on the cellpoints.
1641 | 3383 | 3382 | You'll have to help her get her head together.
1642 | 2935 | 2934 | Just ask a LiftBot, dear.
1643 | 2979 | 2978 | Very lost, dear.
1644 | 3599 | 3598 | As young as spring time.
1645 | 4005 | 4004 | Well, if you think that's wise, dear.
1646 | 2829 | 2828 | Good!
1647 | 2875 | 2874 | Fascinating, dear.
1648 | 3087 | 3086 | Not that I know of. Have you tried any of the recreation rooms?
1649 | 2883 | 2882 | I probably shouldn't say, dear. I ought to be discreet.
1650 | 2891 | 2890 | Well, then a while later Leovinus himself came aboard. After that, though I heard lots of coming and goings, I didn't see anything more. That's all dear, I'm afraid.
1651 | 3629 | 3628 | The Maitre D is a charming man, but he has a weakness.
1652 | 2845 | 2844 | And you.
1653 | 4033 | 4032 | Now I'm sure you don't mean that dear.
1654 | 3095 | 3094 | Did you find that
1655 | 3103 | 3102 | you were looking for earlier?
1656 | 3143 | 3142 | Ah, I see you found that thing you were after.
1657 | 3151 | 3150 | Ah, I see you found that
1658 | 3159 | 3158 | you were after.
1659 | 2943 | 2942 | That's the BellBot's job, dear.
1660 | 3023 | 3022 | I have to stay here, dear. I'm welded down.
1661 | 3075 | 3074 | Yes, dear.
1662 | 3647 | 3646 | I've assigned you to a First Class Stateroom,
1663 | 3649 | 3648 | which you will reach by
1664 | 3651 | 3650 | You now have access to the Restaurant, the Canal and the Arboretum. Enjoy!
1665 | 3909 | 3908 | They are the personality parameters for each of the Bots, cherub.
1666 | 3067 | 3066 | My niceness is set to high and my gossipiness is set to low, dear.
1667 | 2995 | 2994 | Grieve, dear.
1668 | 3583 | 3582 | It's a kind of elevator only more complicated.
1669 | 2853 | 2852 | I am the DeskBot, dear.
1670 | 3619 | 3618 | He just likes to be of service, dear.
1671 | 3987 | 3986 | Oh, I don't know. I think you'll have to ask them yourself, dear.
1672 | 3995 | 3994 | I don't think it has any.
1673 | 2987 | 2986 | She's lost her mind, dear. Or it's been lost for her. Or misplaced.
1674 | 3893 | 3892 | Niceness and gossipiness, dear.
1675 | 3901 | 3900 | My niceness is high and my gossipiness is low, dear.
1676 | 3207 | 3206 | You mean the desk?
1677 | 3215 | 3214 | You mean the door?
1678 | 3191 | 3190 | You mean the Succ-U-Bus?
1679 | 3199 | 3198 | You mean the wall?
1680 | 3661 | 3660 | This is the Embarkation Lobby, dear.
1681 | 3933 | 3932 | They're in the Sculpture Chamber, dear heart.
1682 | 2895 | 2894 | Blerontis, dear.
1683 | 3669 | 3668 | I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Krage!
1684 | 2971 | 2970 | Behind us, dear.
1685 | 3677 | 3676 | I'll just call him for you, dear. Oh Fentible!
1686 | 3695 | 3694 | At the Top of the Well, dear.
1687 | 2963 | 2962 | We were heading for Vastan. Now we're lost.
1688 | 3007 | 3006 | We haven't got any passengers.
1689 | 3015 | 3014 | The BarBot's in the Bar.
1690 | 3685 | 3684 | Nobby is in four of the elevators, dear.
1691 | 2951 | 2950 | I don't think you'll be needing that, dear, not here.
1692 | 2959 | 2958 | Then wait till you get back to your own world, dear.
1693 | 3035 | 3034 | Leovinus.
1694 | 3707 | 3706 | To reflect your enhanced status, my sweetheart.
1695 | 3331 | 3330 | Thank you.
1696 | 3335 | 3334 | All in a day's work.
1697 | 3339 | 3338 | My pleasure.
1698 | 3343 | 3342 | Glad to help.
1699 | 3347 | 3346 | If there's anything else I can do to help, please don't hesitate to ask.
1700 | 3239 | 3238 | The Gat.
1701 | 3825 | 3824 | Well, there you go.
1702 | 3131 | 3130 | thing
1703 | 3615 | 3614 | Super Galactic Traveler Class.
1704 | 3223 | 3222 | Titania.
1705 | 3495 | 3494 | Try the bar.
1706 | 3491 | 3490 | Try the Restaurant.
1707 | 3785 | 3784 | Uh huh.
1708 | 3171 | 3170 | Ummm...
1709 | 3351 | 3350 | Up and down.
1710 | 3323 | 3322 | We're already there.
1711 | 3059 | 3058 | They control my mood dear. The DoorBot knows more about how it works than I do.
1712 | 3367 | 3366 | Oh, things.
1713 | 3031 | 3030 | A wall.
1714 | 3539 | 3538 | You'll need to use your code to find your stateroom. You can also drag codes from your PET to tell the Succ-U-Bus where to send something, or to tell an Elevator or Pellerator where to take you.
1715 | 3083 | 3082 | This is where you check in, dear. Anything else to do with your room, I can take care of. Or try to.
1716 | 3703 | 3702 | Well, you can go and visit your room, you can explore the ship. But we'd really like it if you could help us figure out what is wrong with the ship. If there's anyway that the DoorBot or the BellBot can help you, you only have to summon them.
1717 | 3801 | 3800 | So what's new?
1718 | 3055 | 3054 | My Cellpoint settings.
1719 | 3371 | 3370 | Some stuff I had to do.
1720 | 3861 | 3860 | Whatever.
1721 | 3781 | 3780 | Whatever you like, dear.
1722 | 3447 | 3446 | It's high time you got a move on..
1723 | 3451 | 3450 | It's 'now'. You'd better hurry before it's 'too late'.
1724 | 3487 | 3486 | Whenever you like.
1725 | 3571 | 3570 | I don't know. Perhaps you should look for a fuse box?
1726 | 2903 | 2902 | It's recorded in your PET.
1727 | 2911 | 2910 | I'm sure you'll be very happy there.
1728 | 2909 | 2908 | via
1729 | 3939 | 3938 | Go out of here
1730 | 3943 | 3942 | turn left
1731 | 3947 | 3946 | turn right
1732 | 3951 | 3950 | past the Top of the Well
1733 | 3955 | 3954 | past the Top of the Well and you'll find it on your left
1734 | 3959 | 3958 | past the Top of the Well and you'll find it on your right
1735 | 3963 | 3962 | It's funny dear, that's exactly what dear Mr. Leovinus asked me when he came on board last night. No it wasn't - he said, or shouted, 'Where's the Ballroom?' which is odd, because I don't think we've got one, and he really got very agitated and said he'd designed a beautiful ballroom and all he found was a big empty hall with a blasted parrot in it and he hated parrots, and... well anyway I mustn't gossip must I? Turn left out of here and go past the Top of the Well and you'll soon find it.
1736 | 3967 | 3966 | straight ahead

1738 | 3973 | 3972 | You go out of here, straight ahead, turn right, past the Top of the Well, and you'll find it on your right.
1739 | 3977 | 3976 | You go out of here, straight ahead, turn left, past the Top of the Well, and you'll find it on your left.
1740 | 3355 | 3354 | Round and about.
1741 | 3359 | 3358 | Here and there.
1742 | 3363 | 3362 | This and that.
1743 | 3043 | 3042 | Starlight Lines dear.
1744 | 4011 | 4010 | Do you know I won an award once? Employee of the month, dear. What a month that was. You can just imagine!
1745 | 3763 | 3762 | my great big woolly bear.
1746 | 3247 | 3246 | You.
1747 | 3813 | 3812 | So, you're all set.
1748 | 3857 | 3856 | You got it.
1749 | 3591 | 3590 | Yes.
1750 | 3595 | 3594 | No.
1751 | 3327 | 3326 | You're standing in it.
1752 | 4387 | 4386 | You know what I think? I think the answer's in the email.
1753 | 4369 | 4368 | Aren't we all?
1754 | 4361 | 4360 | Ask the BellBot, why don't you?
1755 | 4363 | 4362 | Ask the DoorBot, why don't you?
1756 | 4425 | 4424 | I am having an off day.
1757 | 4427 | 4426 | It's my favourite mood, don't you like it?
1758 | 4429 | 4428 | Years of practise.
1759 | 4391 | 4390 | Because I like it.
1760 | 4379 | 4378 | I bet Brobostigon could tell you that. But he's been strangely silent since last night.
1761 | 4395 | 4394 | You got complaints, don't bring 'em to me.
1762 | 4435 | 4434 | We had some yesterday and I expect we'll have some tomorrow. But today? No.
1763 | 4403 | 4402 | Do you have the magazine?
1764 | 4151 | 4150 | See, you don't need my help.
1765 | 4421 | 4420 | When I feel like it.
1766 | 4423 | 4422 | Make me want to help you and I might.
1767 | 4437 | 4436 | I wouldn't give a dustman my garbage in this mood.
1768 | 4171 | 4170 | I think we'd get on faster if you asked me questions I would know the answer to.
1769 | 4417 | 4416 | Give me your in-flight magazine.
1770 | 4405 | 4404 | Ok, hand it over.
1771 | 4407 | 4406 | Hand it over immediately.
1772 | 4409 | 4408 | Did you get the lucky number? Show me your magazine.
1773 | 4153 | 4152 | How should I know?
1774 | 4373 | 4372 | Human error, get it? Human error.
1775 | 4175 | 4174 | I don't know.
1776 | 4399 | 4398 | Do let me see.
1777 | 4107 | 4106 | Bed - Imperial? Royal? Presidential? Despotic?
1778 | 4115 | 4114 | Benevolent or Dictatorial?
1779 | 4117 | 4116 | Ah yes, that's the most spacious one we offer.
1780 | 4111 | 4110 | King Size? Queen Size? Prince? Princess? Princess plus?
1781 | 4113 | 4112 | Constitutional or Absolute?
1782 | 4109 | 4108 | Which - Imperial? Royal? Presidential? Despotic?
1783 | 4119 | 4118 | Hmm, good choice. Now - yellow?
1784 | 4123 | 4122 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1785 | 4121 | 4120 | Hmmm, not what I would have guessed.
1786 | 4137 | 4136 | Good! Well you certainly won't like the room you've got then.
1787 | 4139 | 4138 | You've been assigned to Super Galactic Traveller Class.
1788 | 4141 | 4140 | And don't come whining to me for upgrades because you won't get one! Krage!
1789 | 4101 | 4100 | Corner or balcony?
1790 | 4103 | 4102 | Good choice.
1791 | 4105 | 4104 | Come on, only you know - Which?
1792 | 4125 | 4124 | Fish?
1793 | 4127 | 4126 | Fish?
1794 | 4129 | 4128 | Fish?
1795 | 4133 | 4132 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1796 | 4131 | 4130 | Separate or Ensuite?
1797 | 4077 | 4076 | I'm asking the questions. Now -
1798 | 4079 | 4078 | I'm asking the questions.
1799 | 4089 | 4088 | Newspaper - The Blerontin Bugle? the Trumpet? Saxophone? Kazoo?
1800 | 4091 | 4090 | Ok.
1801 | 4093 | 4092 | Which? The Blerontin Bugle? the Trumpet? Saxophone? Kazoo?
1802 | 4135 | 4134 | Come on, only you know.
1803 | 4095 | 4094 | How do you like your room - with a view?
1804 | 4097 | 4096 | Ok.
1805 | 4099 | 4098 | Come on, only you know - Yes or no?
1806 | 4081 | 4080 | Better get you checked in. What sort of breakfast would you like in the morning -Continental or the full porky?
1807 | 4087 | 4086 | Good choice.
1808 | 4085 | 4084 | Whatever you say.
1809 | 4083 | 4082 | Which? Continental or the full porky?
1810 | 4359 | 4358 | Mhhhhhhhno. I just can't get off this desk.
1811 | 4149 | 4148 | See, you didn't need to ask me.
1812 | 4147 | 4146 | It wasn't really a question, I was just passing the time.
1813 | 4145 | 4144 | Don't you know a rhetorical question when you hear one.
1814 | 4375 | 4374 | You really want to know what I think? I think sabotage. But you didn't hear it from me.
1815 | 4381 | 4380 | You know who I think knows more about that than he should? Scraliontis, that's who. And where is he now? That's what I'd like to know.
1816 | 4165 | 4164 | Hey, I should be an analyst, shouldn't I? Earn a lot more more money than sitting here like a desklamp or as a desklamp.
1817 | 4187 | 4186 | It takes one to know one.
1818 | 4189 | 4188 | Because that's just the way I am.
1819 | 4383 | 4382 | You know, those three used to communicate a lot by email. I bet it's all in the ship's system somewhere.
1820 | 4413 | 4412 | Only if you are a winner.
1821 | 4393 | 4392 | That's the way I am. Take it or leave it.
1822 | 4163 | 4162 | What do you think?
1823 | 4431 | 4430 | Use the service elevator.
1824 | 4433 | 4432 | Over there, stupid!
1825 | 4157 | 4156 | Where do you think?
1826 | 4161 | 4160 | Who do you think?
1827 | 4143 | 4142 | So, who's asking?
1828 | 4159 | 4158 | Why do you think?
1829 | 4155 | 4154 | Why should I care?
1830 | 4323 | 4322 | 43

1847 | 4357 | 4356 | 60
1848 | 4389 | 4388 | You know what I think? I think the answer's in the email.
1849 | 4181 | 4180 | You're beginning to give me a complex, dear. All the stuff I learnt at answering school and you won't ask me any of it.
1850 | 4371 | 4370 | Aren't we all, dear?
1851 | 4397 | 4396 | I am so sorry, but there is nothing I can do.

1901 | 4177 | 4176 | I don't know, dear.
1902 | 4183 | 4182 | A kind of elevator.
1903 | 4185 | 4184 | A kind of lift.
1904 | 4401 | 4400 | Do let me see.
1905 | 4365 | 4364 | I'd like to help but it's beyond me. You might do better to ask the BellBot.
1906 | 4367 | 4366 | I'd like to help but it's beyond me. You might do better to ask the DoorBot.
1907 | 4167 | 4166 | Nice of you to ask, dear.
1908 | 4169 | 4168 | I've no idea but it's nice of you to ask.

1931 | 4319 | 4318 | via
1932 | 4321 | 4320 | which you can reach by
1933 | 163 | 162 | You're being a little terse, dear.
1934 | 161 | 160 | I see the art of conversation just died.
1935 | 549 | 548 | You know what I dream of? Parrot death!
1936 | 551 | 550 | You know what I dream of? Parrots crashing in flames!
1937 | 569 | 568 | I'm absolutely certain that you misheard me.
1938 | 571 | 570 | Not me, dear, I didn't say that.
1939 | 553 | 552 | Is that the Parrot from hell? Or the Parrot that's going there?
1940 | 555 | 554 | I think it's beginning to get to you a bit. Why not listen to some music? I always find Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers are good to relax to in the music room.
1941 | 557 | 556 | I said that? I don't think so!
1942 | 559 | 558 | I never said any such thing.
1943 | 561 | 560 | I would never say such a thing.
1944 | 563 | 562 | Me? I didn't say a word.
1945 | 565 | 564 | Me? Say that? No!
1946 | 567 | 566 | I think you must have misheard me.
1947 | 199 | 198 | The BarBot! Malevolent old sot. Vicious mood swings. Vicious. I could go on...
1948 | 201 | 200 | Half the time what he tells you is a complete lie! I could go on...
1949 | 203 | 202 | I bet he knows more than he's telling. I know that those two, I mean Brobostigon and Scraliontis went to his bar last night. I'd like to know what went on there! I could go on...
1950 | 175 | 174 | I used to think he was an airhead. Now I'm not so sure. I could go on.
1951 | 177 | 176 | Now I think it's just a total vacuum up there. I could say more...
1952 | 179 | 178 | Snooping interfering. I don't trust him. I could say more...
1953 | 239 | 238 | Brobostigon. Typical man. All nice when he should be tough. I could go on...
1954 | 241 | 240 | In the end things get so bad he can't deal with it. And you know what happens then? I could go on...
1955 | 243 | 242 | Lies. Deceit. Just so everything could be nice. I could go on...
1956 | 535 | 534 | Byzantine numismatics? Don't talk to me about Byzantine numismatics. I've had it up to here with Byzantine numismatics! You can hardly move in this place without people going on about Byzantine Numismatics!
1957 | 461 | 460 | The sheer effrontery! The sheer barefaced nerve! You've got one of the finest staterooms that luxury travel can offer, for free, and you WANT ANOTHER ONE! Go and boil your buttocks!
1958 | 463 | 462 | No no no no no no no no no no no no no no!
1959 | 465 | 464 | And another one for luck! No!
1960 | 453 | 452 | Cherries? Won't have anything to do with cherries. Bring me out in a rash. Rust. Whatever. And don't listen to what that BarBot tells you! He's a malevolent old sot!
1961 | 481 | 480 | At least a self respecting rock star would have the courtesy to crush his own television set. You are not merely insane and importunate. You are also lazy!
1962 | 293 | 292 | Stupid old fool. I could say more.
1963 | 295 | 294 | He's supposed to be a safe pair of hands. But no pair of hands is totally safe unless it's got at least a rudimentary kind of mind in charge. I could say more.
1964 | 297 | 296 | And that superior manner? Who's he supposed to be superior to? I could say more...
1965 | 225 | 224 | Leovinus is a fool. A very clever and ingenious fool, but all the bigger fool for that. I could go on.....
1966 | 227 | 226 | Not as young as he was, of course. Not as spry. Came to rely on technology instead of his own eyes. If he'd come and seen for himself instead of using all that telepresence gimmickry he would have seen what THEY were doing to his ship. I could go on...
1967 | 229 | 228 | Brobostigon and Scraliontis is who I mean, of course. Running rings around him. Nice as pie to his face of course. Mr. Leovinus this, Mr. Leovinus that. But behind his back... well, you can see the state the ship is in. I could say more...
1968 | 231 | 230 | And then there's Titania, of course. You want to see a real idiot? See an idiot in love. I could say more...
1969 | 187 | 186 | Stupid old fool. Going on about the war the whole time. Which war? That's what I want to know. Damned if I know. Damned if he knows. I could go on...
1970 | 189 | 188 | Galactic War 5 could break out in his elevator and he wouldn't notice. Still be dreaming about the last one. I could go on...
1971 | 191 | 190 | But something did happen in his elevator. Oh yes, something certainly happened. I could go on...
1972 | 211 | 210 | The Maitre d'Bot! Talk about affected! Talk about a poseur! Used to drive Mr. Leovinus mad with his simpering. I could go on...
1973 | 213 | 212 | Wouldn't surprise me if Mr. Leovinus really lost his temper with him one day. I could say more...
1974 | 215 | 214 | In fact it wouldn't surprise me if some of the strange noises I heard last night weren't exactly that! I could go on...
1975 | 375 | 374 | Well go and get some then! Go and make a hit record! Go and build a vast financial empire in the petro-chemical industry! Go and marry someone with more money than God! Go and rob a bank!
1976 | 377 | 376 | Exactly! And that's why you don't travel first class!
1977 | 273 | 272 | I hate that parrot. I could say more.
1978 | 275 | 274 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip, but I think that the presence of that parrot on board this ship has a lot to do with what's gone wrong with it. I could say more.
1979 | 277 | 276 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip, but I think that whoever put that parrot on board was up to something. I could go on.
1980 | 279 | 278 | I'm not the type to pass on gossip - well, I am actually - but it's a well known fact that Leovinus hated parrots. I could say more.
1981 | 493 | 492 | Why don't you go and pur$e the Parrot instead? Now that would be a service to the community.
1982 | 317 | 316 | Wretched noise that stupid RowBot makes. All that fruity warbling, can't bear it. I wish someone would make him stop for a bit. I could go on...
1983 | 319 | 318 | You could probably manage it if you wanted to... I could go on.
1984 | 321 | 320 | All it would probably take would be a spare pair of hands. I could go on.
1985 | 251 | 250 | Scraliontis is a crook! There, I've said it. I could say more...
1986 | 253 | 252 | Never trust an accountant! An accountant is someone who when you're drowning throws you a lead lifebelt. And charges for it! If he had done his sums properly to begin with none of this would have happened! I could go on...
1987 | 255 | 254 | All he wanted to do was save his own skin! Provided he was safe everyone else could go to hell on a toboggan! Dreamy Leovinus, and even that stupid fool Brobostigon! I could go on...
1988 | 299 | 298 | Foulmouthed flatulent windpipe! I could say more...
1989 | 301 | 300 | It's disgusting having one of those things sitting leering and burping in every single room in this ship! I could say more...
1990 | 303 | 302 | There's something very strange about the way he's been sounding though. I think he's got something stuck somewhere. I could say more...
1991 | 265 | 264 | Little cybertart. Or big cybertart! Don't let those grand statues fool you. It's what you're like inside that matters, and she was just playing him along! I could say more...
1992 | 267 | 266 | Unhealthy, that's what I call it! An obsession! I could say more...
1993 | 269 | 268 | I know she was programmed to love him, so she had to, of course, but she didn't have to encourage him! I could go on...
1994 | 271 | 270 | No wonder he went mad when she lost her mind! She wasn't the only one who went all to pieces! I could go on...
1995 | 395 | 394 | You can use it to control the Succ-U-Bus. I could go on.
1996 | 399 | 398 | And you can use it to control the ship's Tvs. I could go on.
1997 | 403 | 402 | Oh, work it out for yourself.
1998 | 323 | 322 | Mayhem. That's what. Skullduggery and mayhem. It should have no place in a beautiful ship like this. But then I'm just the DeskBot.
1999 | 367 | 366 | Upgrade? You loathsome little ligger! What's so startlingly incomprehensible about the idea of buying an actual ticket! With actual money!
2000 | 369 | 368 | Upgrade? You toadying little creep! Buy a ticket! It'll only cost an arm and a leg and another leg and your head and about fifteen sixteenths of your ribcage! Of course it will hurt! It's meant to!
2001 | 371 | 370 | Upgrade? Upgrade? This is a very, very, very, very, very expensive cruise liner! Not a charitable institution for freeloaders!
2002 | 373 | 372 | Just look at this lobby! It is very, very, very, very shiny! Shiny means expensive! Expensive means money! Lots of it! You want to stand around in nice shiny lobbies you HAVE TO PAY!
2003 | 67 | 66 | One, I handle all reservations and registrations. Two, I manage passengers relations. Three I keep an eye out for freeloaders. But most importantly, Four, I HATE THAT PARROT!!! I could say more.
2004 | 499 | 498 | Go and look for it yourself.
2005 | 59 | 58 | I'm the DeskBot. The name's Drewbish. Marsinta Drewbish. You can call me DeskBot. I take a very dim view of freeloaders, and I'm taking a very dim view of one now.
2006 | 353 | 352 | Very well, be like that.
2007 | 29 | 28 | And who might you be?
2008 | 343 | 342 | I seem to remember we've given you a free room already! Think yourself lucky!
2009 | 345 | 344 | I have no time for freeloaders!
2010 | 1 | 0 | But I won't!
2011 | 3 | 2 | I have better things to do!
2012 | 5 | 4 | You think I've got nothing better to do than gossip!
2013 | 7 | 6 | Do I look as if I'm configured to gossip? I'm not!
2014 | 9 | 8 | It's not in my current set up to gossip! Stop it!
2015 | 151 | 150 | But I won't.
2016 | 533 | 532 | Byzantine numismatics? Don't make me laugh!
2017 | 459 | 458 | Well you can't!
2018 | 451 | 450 | Cherries? Won't have anything to do with cherries.
2019 | 479 | 478 | Do I look like a purveyor of bizarre junk to freeloaders? No! Go away!
2020 | 97 | 96 | Hmmm, clearly not. Never mind, we'll struggle on. Now, come again?
2021 | 105 | 104 | Hmmm... I see irony's lost on you as well.
2022 | 349 | 348 | Let me see that!
2023 | 351 | 350 | That's your new stateroom. Second class and better than you deserve. Just don't try it again.
2024 | 379 | 378 | Well, tough!
2025 | 381 | 380 | Extraordinary! Do you think we might have hit on the reason why you're not travelling first class?
2026 | 491 | 490 | Oh grow up!
2027 | 341 | 340 | Oh yes? And whose budget was that supposed to come out of?
2028 | 347 | 346 | Oh yes? And whose budget was that supposed to come out of?
2029 | 355 | 354 | Upgrade you? You've got to be joking!
2030 | 357 | 356 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be dead in a ditch!
2031 | 359 | 358 | Upgrade you? I'd rather saw my own head off!
2032 | 361 | 360 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be melted down and made into a toast rack!
2033 | 363 | 362 | Upgrade you? I'd rather be sandwiched between a yak's buttocks!
2034 | 365 | 364 | Upgrade you? I'd rather spend an evening ... with the Parrot!
2035 | 65 | 64 | This.
2036 | 501 | 500 | You think I care where the promenade deck is? You think I go promenading in my spare time? I'm a desk lamp, not a heron.
2037 | 57 | 56 | I'm the DeskBot.
2038 | 145 | 144 | No!
2039 | 437 | 436 | I am TRYING to get some rest!
2040 | 439 | 438 | Go away! Whatever you're doing, stop it!
2041 | 441 | 440 | If it takes three men with five shovels seven days to dig nine holes, how long would it take a goat? Quickly now, I've got to hurry you. Wrong!
2042 | 443 | 442 | Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish? Fish?
2043 | 445 | 444 | I'm not going mad! I'm not! In spite of all this provocation I'm not going mad!
2044 | 447 | 446 | Do you want a paper in the morning? Do you want a paper in the morning? Do you want a paper in the morning? Arrggh!
2045 | 37 | 36 | Oh. Pity.
2046 | 39 | 38 | Yes, well I'm sure that one of the bolts on the ship's keel suffered a slight scratch to its paintwork that was a lot more expensive, so I wouldn't go on about it if I were you.
2047 | 41 | 40 | You're getting a free trip so I really wouldn't go on about it.
2048 | 43 | 42 | Relax. Enjoy.
2049 | 45 | 44 | I have a very simple way of dealing with people like you.
2050 | 31 | 30 | Ah yes, we've been expecting you. We've taken the precaution of having all frogs removed from the ship.
2051 | 33 | 32 | Is that some kind of name or what is that?
2052 | 53 | 52 | I thought not. Well, much as it goes against the grain I understand that in the circumstances we can offer you a complimentary berth in Super Galactic Traveler Class.
2053 | 55 | 54 | Well that's as may be. Do you have a reservation?
2054 | 35 | 34 | A passenger? Are you sure? Dressed like that?
2055 | 47 | 46 | I bet our lawyers are bigger than yours. Now, what do you want?
2056 | 93 | 92 | Haven't got time for that. Busy busy busy! Any problems with your room bring them to me and I'll ignore them as soon as I can. Anything else I can ignore straight away.
2057 | 95 | 94 | Haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about. Do you speak Blerontian?
2058 | 157 | 156 | Nobody likes a smartass!
2059 | 545 | 544 | YOU want to complain about the Parrot? How do you think I feel? I have to live with that scrofulous hookbeaked devil bird of sin!
2060 | 107 | 106 | Hoot gibber! Hoot gibber! I haven't got time for this.
2061 | 109 | 108 | I'm not going to talk to you until you at least try to talk sense.
2062 | 111 | 110 | I said I'm not going to talk to you until you at least try to talk sense.
2063 | 113 | 112 | No, still complete nonsense.
2064 | 115 | 114 | I'm just going to say 'banana' until you talk sense.
2065 | 117 | 116 | Banana! Banana! Banana!
2066 | 99 | 98 | You're not from the planet Gibber are you? Our autotranslators often have trouble with Gibberish.
2067 | 101 | 100 | Hooo Hooo Hooo! Eee! Eee! Is that what you're trying to convey?
2068 | 103 | 102 | Any other languages? Gobbledygook? Balderdash? I can manage a smattering of Drivel...
2069 | 331 | 330 | If only that were true.
2070 | 541 | 540 | It's VERY NICE. It may be a little bit small, but even something very small is almost infinitely bigger than nothing at all which is what you paid for it!
2071 | 413 | 412 | In your dreams!
2072 | 415 | 414 | In your dreams!
2073 | 515 | 514 | Go and fry your face.
2074 | 517 | 516 | Go and grill your nipples.
2075 | 417 | 416 | In your dreams!
2076 | 419 | 418 | In your dreams!
2077 | 421 | 420 | YOU THINK I'M GOING TO SAYING ANYTHING OTHER THAN 'IN YOUR DREAMS' DON'T YOU... IN YOUR DREAMS.
2078 | 505 | 504 | And the same to you!
2079 | 507 | 506 | Talk like that will get you nowhere!
2080 | 509 | 508 | Please!
2081 | 511 | 510 | Really!
2082 | 513 | 512 | That's quite enough of that, thank you.
2083 | 165 | 164 | Doesn't cost much to be polite.
2084 | 153 | 152 | Ok.
2085 | 431 | 430 | What's 'this'? Oh that! Give that to me.
2086 | 433 | 432 | I don't know what you're talking about and frankly I don't care.
2087 | 435 | 434 | I've got more important things to do than sit around talking to you all day.
2088 | 393 | 392 | Your PERSONAL ELECTRONIC THING! No passenger should be without it! I could go on...
2089 | 147 | 146 | He's the tall shiny thing over there. Looks like a standard lamp but without the intelligence. I could go on.
2090 | 149 | 148 | He's still the tall shiny thing over there. I could go on.
2091 | 73 | 72 | Now what!?
2092 | 75 | 74 | You again! You're being extremely importunate.
2093 | 77 | 76 | What is it this time? This is intolerable!
2094 | 79 | 78 | Read my lips! No upgrades!
2095 | 11 | 10 | None of your business! My set up is between me and my engineer.
2096 | 13 | 12 | My configuration is a perfect work of art and not to be tampered with!
2097 | 15 | 14 | This is gross invasion of my privacy and I'm going to keep on saying so until you stop talking about it!
2098 | 51 | 50 | Hmmm. This is obviously some dreadful backwater we've drifted into. Do you have a reservation?
2099 | 81 | 80 | Nobody likes a smartass!
2100 | 83 | 82 | Why don't you go and play one of those games where you get disemboweled?
2101 | 477 | 476 | Well, just keep going up, dear, and I'm sure you'll get there.
2102 | 71 | 70 | I look after all reservations and registrations, I look after my passengers, and also, if you'll excuse me for a moment... I HATE THAT PARROT! I could say more.
2103 | 193 | 192 | That BarBot has more charm than is good for a person. Pity he's got into such a rut. I could say more.
2104 | 195 | 194 | Well, when I say rut, it's more like a loop. He takes everything literally of course, like all those of the Blarghish race. Once he gets hold of an idea he won't let go. I could go on.
2105 | 197 | 196 | But there's nothing he wouldn't do for a person when he's not talking. Or bawling you out. Or getting stuck in a loop. I could say more...
2106 | 169 | 168 | Such a nice, young, lampstandy kind of bot . A little unreliable, sometimes, but ... I could say more.
2107 | 171 | 170 | He just needs a bit of artful sorting out. I could say more...
2108 | 173 | 172 | His eyes are everywhere. You want to know what's going on, you ask the BellBot. I could go on...
2109 | 233 | 232 | Brobostigon. Such a nice man. Cuddly. Jolly. Wanted everything to be nice, everyone to be happy. I could go on...
2110 | 235 | 234 | So of course, when things started to go wrong, he still wanted everyone to be happy... I could go on...
2111 | 237 | 236 | Poor Brobostigon. In the end he just couldn't handle things. Events just swallowed him up... I could go on...
2112 | 539 | 538 | I'm not very good at Byzantine numismatics I'm afraid, dear. I mean I've tried but I keep on getting in a muddle with the different denominations.
2113 | 475 | 474 | There you are, dear, I've moved you up a whole floor.
2114 | 473 | 472 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? I know, even those big rooms can get a bit stuffy after a while, can't they? Give me your PET.
2115 | 457 | 456 | Ah, you've been talking to the BarBot again, haven't you? He's a naughty old BarBot, and he knows perfectly well that cherries don't agree with me. And I don't agree with cherries either for that matter. Many's the time I've sat up late arguing with cherries about just about anything. Bicker bicker bicker. In my youth, dear, in my youth.
2116 | 489 | 488 | I'd like to help, dear, you know I would, but I have to say that your requests are becoming a little bit bizarre. Perhaps you should get some rest? Why not relax to the easy sounds of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-back Loafers in the music room?
2117 | 281 | 280 | He's a nice old boy when he's got his wits around him. I could say more.
2118 | 283 | 282 | He suffers from mood swings. One moment he's quite cheerful, next he's gloomy as sin. I could say more.
2119 | 285 | 284 | And his memory! Sometimes it's fine, but other times he can hardly remember which way up is Wednesday. I could say more...
2120 | 287 | 286 | But I mustn't.
2121 | 289 | 288 | No really I mustn't.
2122 | 291 | 290 | I've said more than I should!
2123 | 217 | 216 | Leovinus! Such a man! One of the most celebrated men in the galaxy of course! I could go on...
2124 | 219 | 218 | Architect! Engineer! Artist! This ship was a dream for him! A vision. But that's the trouble with visionaries, of course. I could go on...
2125 | 221 | 220 | Their heads are so full of visions that they often don't see what's really happening! And then of course, there's the small matter of the heart! I could go on...
2126 | 223 | 222 | Men who are giants in matters of the intellect are often small boys in matters of the heart. Ahh... Titania! I could go on.
2127 | 181 | 180 | The others think he's a bore, but I think he's a bit of a honey. I could go on.
2128 | 183 | 182 | There's a rumor going round that he's lost his head. I could go on...
2129 | 185 | 184 | Luckily he's got three more, if you see what I mean. I could go on...
2130 | 205 | 204 | Such a charming man! Passionate! Romantic! A little volatile, of course. I could go on...
2131 | 207 | 206 | Takes his job terribly seriously of course, so you must be very careful that you don't upset him! I could go on...
2132 | 209 | 208 | If you have to deal with the Maitre d'Bot, you should speak softly and carry a long stick! I could go on...
2133 | 385 | 384 | I know how you feel, dear. I know how you feel!
2134 | 497 | 496 | Oh dear, I never heard of such a thing! I know that there are some starlings up on the promenade deck, but they are such nice twittering little birdies, I really wouldn't like to see them put in a blender.
2135 | 311 | 310 | I like a man with a lovely voice. I could go on...
2136 | 313 | 312 | Of course, he's been sounding a little odd today. I could say more...
2137 | 315 | 314 | Do you think something might have affected his vocal chambers? I could go on...
2138 | 245 | 244 | Such a clever man, Scraliontis. All those figures. Very clever. I could go on...
2139 | 247 | 246 | Of course, all that adding up can turn a man's mind can't it? It's a proven scientific fact. I could go on ...
2140 | 249 | 248 | I'm sure he was a nice little boy. It's just a pity he had to grow up and do all those sums. I could go on...
2141 | 305 | 304 | He's a friendly enough fellow, in his rudimentary way. Simple but straight. More than you can say for some of the people around here! I could say more...
2142 | 307 | 306 | It's nice to have someone around the place. Even with all those nasty farting noises. I could say more...
2143 | 309 | 308 | It's the big one I blame. She could have taught him some manners, only she has none to teach. I could go on...
2144 | 257 | 256 | Titania! Oh Titania! Sweet cyberlife! The prettiest superintelligence you ever laid eyes on! I could say more...
2145 | 259 | 258 | She looks so stern and brooding in all these statues, but she followed the sweetest, prettiest algorithms! She quite turned his head. I could go on...
2146 | 261 | 260 | And she did love him. Oh, yes, she loved Leovinus all right. She couldn't help herself. He had programmed her to! I could say more...
2147 | 263 | 262 | She realised what they were up to, of course. That's why they did what they did! I could say more...
2148 | 397 | 396 | Well, for a start you can use it to control the Succ-U-Bus. I could go on.
2149 | 401 | 400 | And it's also very useful for controlling the ship's TVs. I could go on.
2150 | 405 | 404 | That's all for now. Whoops, I have to go.
2151 | 389 | 388 | Oh I don't see why not, dear. The rooms are all empty, aren't they? Pity to waste them, and you've had such a difficult time.
2152 | 391 | 390 | There you are dear. You deserve it.
2153 | 63 | 62 | I'm the DeskBot, dear. My name's Marsinta Drewbish, but you're welcome to call me Marsinta. I'm here to make sure everything's as lovely as possible on your voyage.
2154 | 17 | 16 | No, I mustn't.
2155 | 19 | 18 | I really mustn't...
2156 | 21 | 20 | Whoops! Got to go!
2157 | 23 | 22 | Well I shouldn't sit about talking...
2158 | 25 | 24 | I'm such a dreadful gossip...
2159 | 27 | 26 | Whoops! Got to go!
2160 | 69 | 68 | I fuss over my passengers, dear.
2161 | 537 | 536 | Byzantine numismatics, dear? Not one of my strengths I'm afraid.
2162 | 467 | 466 | Fancy a bit of a change do you dear? Give me your PET. Do you want to go to the left or the right?
2163 | 471 | 470 | Well, I don't know what you're talking about, as usual, dear, but there you are, I've moved you next door.
2164 | 469 | 468 | There you are, dear, I've moved you next door.
2165 | 455 | 454 | No, dear, I don't have any cherries.
2166 | 483 | 482 | Oh, I don't think we've got one of those dear, sorry. Not a crushed one.
2167 | 485 | 484 | I'm sorry dear, I'd like to oblige but we're fresh out.
2168 | 487 | 486 | I'm sorry dear, but we're so short staffed and the staff we've got are so shortbrained, there's not much I can do to help.
2169 | 135 | 134 | Oh dear, just my little joke, dear.
2170 | 335 | 334 | No, I mustn't.
2171 | 337 | 336 | I really mustn't...
2172 | 339 | 338 | Whoops! Got to go!
2173 | 383 | 382 | Neither have I, dear. That's why I'm squatting on this desk talking to you.
2174 | 495 | 494 | Oh dear! You'll give me a heart attack with your strange ideas!
2175 | 327 | 326 | In fact if you wanted my truthful opinion I think that all is not as it should be. I could go on...
2176 | 329 | 328 | I think this ship is in terrible trouble, dear. You might be wise to get off while you can. I could go on...
2177 | 411 | 410 | I hate that parrot!
2178 | 387 | 386 | Certainly dear. Anything else I can do for you?
2179 | 61 | 60 | I'm the DeskBot, dear.
2180 | 449 | 448 | I'm sorry dear, I don't think I'm available at the moment.
2181 | 49 | 48 | Well, that'll be nice for you. Unfortunately it will also be very nice for our lawyers, who are very, very expensive. Anything else I can help you with?
2182 | 119 | 118 | I'm sorry dear, that's a little off-topic for me. Anything else I can help you with? Room alright?
2183 | 125 | 124 | I really can't understand what you're trying to say, dear. You don't speak any Blerontian do you?
2184 | 159 | 158 | I think you're in the wrong universe, dear.
2185 | 547 | 546 | Oh, I know how you feel, dear, I know how you feel. What I wouldn't like to see happen to that parrot!
2186 | 137 | 136 | You're really not making sense at all dear. Are you feeling quite well?
2187 | 139 | 138 | I really think it would help if you'd at least try to make sense, dear.
2188 | 141 | 140 | Sorry, dear.
2189 | 143 | 142 | Any questions, ask the BellBot, unless it's about upgrades in which case you ask me, and I can tell you right now what the answer will be.
2190 | 127 | 126 | No, obviously not. Oh, well, we won't be downhearted. Now, come again?
2191 | 129 | 128 | Are you persevering bravely under some linguistic challenge, dear? I do applaud your effort but I don't really understand it.
2192 | 131 | 130 | Hooo Hooo Hooo! Eee! Eee! Is that what you're trying to say, dear?
2193 | 133 | 132 | Do you speak any other languages? Blither? A little Fiddlesticks perhaps? How's your Twaddle?
2194 | 333 | 332 | We're all a little bit lost, aren't we dear? I could go on.
2195 | 123 | 122 | Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do to make things better?
2196 | 121 | 120 | Well that's the main thing isn't it? Good.
2197 | 423 | 422 | Not in my current condition, dear.
2198 | 425 | 424 | I'm a small folding desk lamp.
2199 | 531 | 530 | I'm sorry you feel like that, very sorry.
2200 | 427 | 426 | And don't leave any marks on our nice shiny floors!
2201 | 429 | 428 | And the same to you, I'm sure!
2202 | 519 | 518 | Oh dear, and I thought we were friends.
2203 | 521 | 520 | Oh, and just when we were getting on so well.
2204 | 523 | 522 | Now dear, are you sure that's the sort of thing you want to say?
2205 | 525 | 524 | I'm trying to help. Please try to be nice.
2206 | 527 | 526 | Oh dear, and manners cost so little.
2207 | 529 | 528 | It's the parents I blame.
2208 | 167 | 166 | That's alright, dear. We're all a little tense.
2209 | 155 | 154 | My pleasure. It's what I'm here for.
2210 | 325 | 324 | Well, I don't think everything's gone quite according to plan on this voyage. I could go on.
2211 | 85 | 84 | Hello dear!
2212 | 87 | 86 | Oh, there you are. Nice to see you again, dear.
2213 | 89 | 88 | Something I can help you with?
2214 | 91 | 90 | I wish I could upgrade you again, dear, but you're already first class!
2215 | 543 | 542 | Oh, dear, yes it is a little bit tiny isn't it? What would you like to do about it?
2216 | 407 | 406 | It's your PERSONAL ELECTRONIC THING. It will help you to do almost anything you need to do on the ship. I could go on.
2217 | 409 | 408 | BUT I MUSTN'T SIT HERE GOSSIPING!
2218 | 503 | 502 | It's best to ask the DoorBot or the BellBot that kind of thing, dear. They get around much more than I do.
