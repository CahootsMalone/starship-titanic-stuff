87 | 1059 | 1058 | It is.
88 | 1061 | 1060 | They do.
89 | 1063 | 1062 | They are.
90 | 1065 | 1064 | Could be.
91 | 1067 | 1066 | Sure is.
92 | 1069 | 1068 | What's the point in that?
93 | 1071 | 1070 | Oh, I see.
94 | 1073 | 1072 | Oh, I don't know.
95 | 1003 | 1002 | I wouldn't.
96 | 1075 | 1074 | I love it very much.
97 | 1077 | 1076 | I am not so sure about that.
98 | 1079 | 1078 | I never was a great fan.
99 | 1081 | 1080 | They have.
100 | 1083 | 1082 | A little.
101 | 1085 | 1084 | I know.
102 | 1087 | 1086 | I should think not.
103 | 1089 | 1088 | Many times.
104 | 1091 | 1090 | Never again.
105 | 1093 | 1092 | I might.
106 | 1005 | 1004 | Really?
107 | 1095 | 1094 | It might.
108 | 1097 | 1096 | No can do.
109 | 1099 | 1098 | Not so fast, my friend.
110 | 1101 | 1100 | Well, I'm not.
111 | 1103 | 1102 | That's good.
112 | 1105 | 1104 | Just a hunch.
113 | 943 | 942 | I'm not.
114 | 945 | 944 | I am.
115 | 947 | 946 | You're not.
116 | 949 | 948 | You are.
117 | 951 | 950 | You will.
118 | 965 | 964 | No way.
119 | 1007 | 1006 | Would you?
120 | 953 | 952 | Oh...
121 | 955 | 954 | Ah...
122 | 957 | 956 | Oh dear...
123 | 959 | 958 | Me too!
124 | 961 | 960 | Please?
125 | 963 | 962 | Yeah, right.
126 | 967 | 966 | Isn't she?
127 | 969 | 968 | Isn't he?
128 | 971 | 970 | Aren't they?
129 | 973 | 972 | Won't they?
130 | 975 | 974 | Won't she?
131 | 1009 | 1008 | Do you?
132 | 977 | 976 | Won't he?
133 | 979 | 978 | Does he?
134 | 981 | 980 | Mmmm, does she?
135 | 983 | 982 | Do they?
136 | 985 | 984 | Go on.
137 | 987 | 986 | Continuez.
138 | 989 | 988 | Is that so?
139 | 991 | 990 | Is that right?
140 | 993 | 992 | My goodness.
141 | 995 | 994 | Uh oh.
142 | 997 | 996 | I see.
143 | 1011 | 1010 | Will you?
144 | 1109 | 1108 | Pas de probleme!
145 | 1107 | 1106 | No problem.
146 | 1111 | 1110 | That's right.
147 | 1113 | 1112 | Of course.
148 | 1115 | 1114 | Could be.
149 | 1117 | 1116 | Who?
150 | 1119 | 1118 | What?
151 | 1121 | 1120 | Where?
152 | 1123 | 1122 | Why?
153 | 1125 | 1124 | When?
154 | 1127 | 1126 | Is he?
155 | 1013 | 1012 | Are you sure?
156 | 1129 | 1128 | Is she?
157 | 1131 | 1130 | Are they?
158 | 1133 | 1132 | Will he?
159 | 1135 | 1134 | Will she?
160 | 1137 | 1136 | Will they?
161 | 1139 | 1138 | Did he?
162 | 1141 | 1140 | Did she?
163 | 1143 | 1142 | Did they?
164 | 1145 | 1144 | Just like you.
165 | 1147 | 1146 | Just like me.
166 | 341 | 340 | Je suis desol$, sieur/dame, that table is occup$ by a vairry distinguished customer. He has been lingering over his caf$ for seventeen hours so I am sure he will be calling for the bill in one second...
167 | 903 | 902 | The day after.
168 | 923 | 922 | Hammerday, Rowday, Welday, Harday, Spryday, Otherday, Flatterday, Umph.
169 | 901 | 900 | The day before.
170 | 919 | 918 | Flatterday.
171 | 905 | 904 | Hammerday.
172 | 911 | 910 | Harday.
173 | 913 | 912 | Harday, as in Harday's night.
174 | 899 | 898 | Today is.
175 | 917 | 916 | Otherday.
176 | 907 | 906 | Rowday.
177 | 915 | 914 | Spryday.
178 | 921 | 920 | Umph.
179 | 909 | 908 | Welday.
180 | 939 | 938 | Delightful.
181 | 1215 | 1214 | DeskBot.
182 | 625 | 624 | Salle a manger!
183 | 551 | 550 | I do not think so.
184 | 1211 | 1210 | DoorBot.
185 | 705 | 704 | This Doreen is not my cup of tea! I live for Boppy Headcase alone.
186 | 925 | 924 | Every day.
187 | 595 | 594 | Exactement!
188 | 855 | 854 | Fantastic!
189 | 805 | 804 | You think this is a laughing matter? I will fight you!
190 | 739 | 738 | I will check with the chef.
191 | 741 | 740 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, that due to a previous passenger choice, that selection is no long available. Je suis desol$.
192 | 759 | 758 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, your request is unavailable. There is no reason.
193 | 743 | 742 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, that the chef has eaten it himself. Je suis desol$.
194 | 745 | 744 | The chef says there is no 'ggrrr' in the month. Pardon, sieur/dame.
195 | 747 | 746 | The chef says it is not possible today. Je suis desol$.
196 | 749 | 748 | The chef says he has nevaairr heard of it. Je suis desol$.
197 | 751 | 750 | The chef says that in honor of the memory of his sainted mother he will not cook that dish again.
198 | 753 | 752 | The chef says that this is very dirty food. He will not cook dirty food.
199 | 755 | 754 | The chef has gone to Betelgeuse to visit his cousin. And by the way, he is very naughty. And dead.
200 | 757 | 756 | I'm afraid, sieur/dame, I cannot accede to such an extraordinary culinary request. And that is all there is to it.
201 | 571 | 570 | You would do well to forsake that line of enquiry, my friend.
202 | 711 | 710 | You say so? Then I will fight you!
203 | 767 | 766 | I am proud to say I am Galloid, sieur/dame.
204 | 717 | 716 | You think so my friend? Then have a care! Things can very easily go... less well.
205 | 1207 | 1206 | And now I will fight you.
206 | 773 | 772 | I trust you will not be leaving us so soon. Believe me.
207 | 397 | 396 | Haha HaHa! HaHa!
208 | 399 | 398 | Haha HaHa! HaHa!
209 | 401 | 400 | Haha HaHa! HaHa!
210 | 403 | 402 | You laugh at me? I fight you!
211 | 633 | 632 | Haloa!
212 | 723 | 722 | When you are seated at your table, if ever.
213 | 343 | 342 | But of course. It is the Blerontinian sign of appreciation of a good meal, I think.
214 | 639 | 638 | Hello!
215 | 657 | 656 | Let's shake it baby.
216 | 659 | 658 | I move my bottom vairry good.
217 | 661 | 660 | Go bottom, go!
218 | 663 | 662 | Allez le bottom.
219 | 665 | 664 | Get down, sieur/dame, get down!
220 | 667 | 666 | Hey, let's kick bottom!
221 | 669 | 668 | Hey let's kick some butt, baby!
222 | 671 | 670 | Boogie woogie, baby!
223 | 673 | 672 | You put your left leg in, your left leg out, in out, in out, shake it all about. No, your left leg, you silly bottom.
224 | 675 | 674 | Wiggle it, baby, wiggle it!
225 | 641 | 640 | Guten Tag!
226 | 677 | 676 | Move me, Boppy, baby, move me!
227 | 679 | 678 | Je t'aime, Boppy, you are the king of Bop!
228 | 643 | 642 | Ciao baby!
229 | 645 | 644 | G'day mate!
230 | 647 | 646 | How does it hang?
231 | 649 | 648 | How ya doing?
232 | 651 | 650 | Have a nice day.
233 | 653 | 652 | Hang loose, baby.
234 | 655 | 654 | That's rock and roll baby.
235 | 505 | 504 | HELP! HELP! HELP!
236 | 629 | 628 | Heepy heepy shake!
237 | 775 | 774 | Non, Sieur/dame. Regrettably.
238 | 521 | 520 | How indeed, my friend, how indeed.
239 | 533 | 532 | How do you think?
240 | 687 | 686 | Ah, sieur/dame believes I am a green Indian, no ?
241 | 389 | 388 | You must change the cylinder on the music machine.
242 | 847 | 846 | How come?
243 | 857 | 856 | How did you know?
244 | 481 | 480 | It is obvious you fool! You put the music cylinder in the music cylinder slot.
245 | 487 | 486 | Practice, my friend, practice!
246 | 467 | 466 | There is a leetle apparatus in the lobby.
247 | 861 | 860 | How much?
248 | 501 | 500 | It is very simple, I think. You must make sure that each of Boppy's musicians has their part set up correctly, you must set the machine to record and then let the band play!
249 | 503 | 502 | You must listen, you cloth-eared idiot person!
250 | 621 | 620 | D'accord.
251 | 367 | 366 | I think so! I will fight you!
252 | 829 | 828 | Sieur/dame, I do not wish to be rude, but nevertheless, I am.
253 | 871 | 870 | I am amazing, n'est-ce pas?
254 | 873 | 872 | I am a Bot.
255 | 1249 | 1248 | I do not know.
256 | 369 | 368 | Then have a care, sieur/dame, have a care! I am very tense with this terrible music!
257 | 371 | 370 | Then do not molest me with your incontinent words! Consult, instead, the menu!
258 | 877 | 876 | I don't feel so good.
259 | 405 | 404 | You mock me with with this... this semantic nicetiness? This tomfoolery of the tongue? I will fight you! Ha Ha! Now you see, huh?
260 | 407 | 406 | I mean that I have bested you in the combat of the jest, my friend!
261 | 725 | 724 | I think you will not like the chicken.
262 | 727 | 726 | I insist that you will not like the chicken.
263 | 729 | 728 | Then I insist that I insist that you will not like the chicken!
264 | 731 | 730 | Then I insist that I insist that I insist that you will not like the chicken!
265 | 733 | 732 | Well, you can't have it anyway.
266 | 737 | 736 | Then I will fight you!
267 | 735 | 734 | Because you can't.
268 | 851 | 850 | I thought so.
269 | 393 | 392 | Menu sieur/dame? What menu?
270 | 695 | 694 | The bill is, as always, too elevated to contemplate.
271 | 841 | 840 | Right in front of you.
272 | 415 | 414 | Oh, I don't know about that sieur/dame... Maybe a little stressed.
273 | 607 | 606 | En effet.
274 | 933 | 932 | Indeed.
275 | 885 | 884 | Interesting.
276 | 391 | 390 | All of life is a puzzle, I think. No?
277 | 789 | 788 | In my experience, there is always a bomb on board.
278 | 849 | 848 | It is a possibility.
279 | 803 | 802 | English food. Ha ha ha ha ha!
280 | 631 | 630 | Johnny Holiday!
281 | 763 | 762 | I do not recognize that as a foodstuff!
282 | 563 | 562 | Just because!
283 | 1217 | 1216 | LiftBot.
284 | 811 | 810 | That is not music! That is the sound of a thousand sparrows farting!
285 | 813 | 812 | You call that music? That is the sound of a pig vomiting.
286 | 815 | 814 | I do not listen to this! I would rather stick my head in a cow's bottom!
287 | 809 | 808 | I would rather hear a singing camel!
288 | 853 | 852 | Lovely!
289 | 719 | 718 | It means that I am the waiter who must be obeyed!
290 | 277 | 276 | Maybe.
291 | 409 | 408 | You try to embarrass me with my menulessness? I will fight you!
292 | 889 | 888 | Mon dieu!
293 | 693 | 692 | You think so? Then I will fight you.
294 | 577 | 576 | My friend.
295 | 937 | 936 | Neat.
296 | 891 | 890 | Never.
297 | 935 | 934 | Nice.
298 | 769 | 768 | You think so? I do not think so. Maybe. I do not know. Who cares?
299 | 771 | 770 | Nice I do not know. Plentiful I would say.
300 | 279 | 278 | No ?, Are you sure ?
301 | 297 | 296 | Of course not.
302 | 299 | 298 | Of course.
303 | 301 | 300 | Very good.
304 | 303 | 302 | No? I spit on your puny refusal!
305 | 305 | 304 | No? You think I will not fight you, but I will.
306 | 307 | 306 | No? But I insist!
307 | 309 | 308 | No? But I fight you nevertheless!
308 | 311 | 310 | No? You are a contemptible jamjar full of naughty things!
309 | 313 | 312 | No? You are underneath my contempt!
310 | 315 | 314 | No? No?! No???!!
311 | 281 | 280 | I, sieur/dame, am also not so sure now you mention thees.
312 | 317 | 316 | No?
313 | 319 | 318 | No.
314 | 321 | 320 | No.
315 | 323 | 322 | No? Very well. We will stagger on regardless.
316 | 283 | 282 | I understand how you feel, sieur/dame.
317 | 285 | 284 | No? You say so?
318 | 287 | 286 | No? I think you do not mean to contradict me...
319 | 289 | 288 | No? I think you will regret your negativity in this matter.
320 | 291 | 290 | No? Bien sur.
321 | 293 | 292 | No? I understand.
322 | 295 | 294 | I understand.
323 | 579 | 578 | I should not be surprised.
324 | 897 | 896 | Ah yes, but not on weldays.
325 | 1185 | 1184 | Not since last...
326 | 1183 | 1182 | Not until next...
327 | 611 | 610 | Naturellement.
328 | 613 | 612 | Naturellement, bien sur.
329 | 807 | 806 | There is no music but Boppy Headcase.
330 | 833 | 832 | Over there!
331 | 835 | 834 | Over there?
332 | 573 | 572 | Parfait!
333 | 1247 | 1246 | Perhaps the BellBot will be of assistance.
334 | 1181 | 1180 | Perhaps by...
335 | 1245 | 1244 | Perhaps the DeskBot will be of assistance.
336 | 1241 | 1240 | Perhaps the DoorBot will be of assistance.
337 | 1243 | 1242 | Perhaps the LiftBot will be of assistance.
338 | 1237 | 1236 | I do not know. Perhaps the.
339 | 799 | 798 | Ah, it is you once more. Do you have the delectable music of Boppy?
340 | 545 | 544 | Possibly.
341 | 549 | 548 | Possibly not.
342 | 543 | 542 | Probably.
343 | 547 | 546 | Probably not.
344 | 325 | 324 | Enfin! Enough! You win the day! I submit the towel! I throw in the ghost! My white flag enlofts! I yield to your superior bottom-prodding strategies! So! How may I be of assistance to you?
345 | 1187 | 1186 | Al q'Hamra.
346 | 1193 | 1192 | Bristil.
347 | 1191 | 1190 | Genneth.
348 | 1201 | 1200 | Hwhifft.
349 | 1203 | 1202 | Forty days hath Al q'Hamra, Tarbert, Hwhifft, Splod and Vortigan. All the rest have forty, too, i. e., Genneth, m'Bristil and Voedio.
350 | 1205 | 1204 | The lazy days of Splod are here. Rise with the sun, and go down with diarrhea.
351 | 1195 | 1194 | Splod.
352 | 1197 | 1196 | Tarbert.
353 | 1199 | 1198 | Voedio.
354 | 1189 | 1188 | Vortigan.
355 | 623 | 622 | Pret a Porter.
356 | 941 | 940 | Repugnant.
357 | 843 | 842 | Right here!
358 | 1219 | 1218 | RowBot.
359 | 709 | 708 | You say so? Then I will fight you!
360 | 777 | 776 | I think you will find that all of our dishes are already perfectly seasoned, sieur/dame.
361 | 879 | 878 | You can say that again.
362 | 721 | 720 | Not from here, I'm afraid.
363 | 827 | 826 | Sieur/dame.
364 | 575 | 574 | Sieur/dame.
365 | 1173 | 1172 | I have tried, sieur/dame, I have tried.
366 | 635 | 634 | Skol!
367 | 893 | 892 | Sometimes.
368 | 783 | 782 | Non, sieur/dame, I speak... Waiter.
369 | 791 | 790 | Treat it like a woman! Interrupt it all the time!
370 | 881 | 880 | Stop it!
371 | 419 | 418 | Please do not make jokes about my condition, sieur/dame, or I will fight you.
372 | 327 | 326 | Ah, I think not, sieur/dame.
373 | 329 | 328 | Sieur/dame, allow me to correct you. I think I know my own tables in my own restaurant, no?
374 | 331 | 330 | Tables do not suddenly become empty for M. Naughty Words! I will fight you!
375 | 867 | 866 | That amazes me!
376 | 863 | 862 | That's good.
377 | 865 | 864 | C'est merveilleux!
378 | 583 | 582 | That is normal.
379 | 587 | 586 | That is not normal.
380 | 1233 | 1232 | the BellBot.
381 | 1229 | 1228 | the DeskBot.
382 | 1227 | 1226 | the DoorBot.
383 | 1231 | 1230 | the LiftBot.
384 | 831 | 830 | There!
385 | 761 | 760 | There is no reason.
386 | 615 | 614 | Voila!
387 | 617 | 616 | Et le voila!
388 | 555 | 554 | I think not.
389 | 553 | 552 | I think so.
390 | 585 | 584 | This is normal.
391 | 589 | 588 | This is not normal.
392 | 931 | 930 | Undoubtedly.
393 | 707 | 706 | You will not be so fussy after reading the menu!
394 | 601 | 600 | Very good!
395 | 603 | 602 | Tres bien!
396 | 605 | 604 | Bien!
397 | 581 | 580 | I would be vairry surprised.
398 | 801 | 800 | Vive la France!
399 | 413 | 412 | No, you are wasting mine. You want to do something useful? Change the music! The night is yet young...
400 | 1179 | 1178 | I think she was a very fine person, of course.
401 | 1177 | 1176 | I think he was a very fine person, of course.
402 | 525 | 524 | What indeed, my friend, what indeed.
403 | 529 | 528 | Whatever.
404 | 541 | 540 | What do you think?
405 | 685 | 684 | Whatever sieur/dame wants.
406 | 357 | 356 | Monsieur Naughty Chef.
407 | 433 | 432 | He leaves in a teeny leetle bit of a tizzy!
408 | 431 | 430 | M. Scraliontis, he comes into my restaurant, of course, he hands me a small piece of Titania's brain, of course, and then, after M. Leovinus enters also and throws me to the ground, of course, and the two of them fight like tigers with my arms, of course, and M. Leovinus biffs M. Scraliontis mightily with, I think it is my left arm, of course, M. Scraliontis sits and lingers mightily over his caf$, of course.
409 | 385 | 384 | How can anybody do anything with this terrible music playing?
410 | 449 | 448 | M. Scraliontis is the accountant. Need I say more?
411 | 451 | 450 | I think M Scraliontis he was boiling his books!
412 | 429 | 428 | M. Leovinus and M. Scraliontis, they fight lustily!
413 | 421 | 420 | I get a little bit picked up and then a tiny bit thrown to the ground, and then I think just the merest soupcon stamped on. And I think it is just possible that my limbs were torn off and used in hand to hand combat. Pouff! It happens.
414 | 781 | 780 | We are lost in space. The robots are out of control. The ship's cyberintelligence is in pieces. I could cope with it if it wasn't for this terrible music.
415 | 779 | 778 | I think it is you. I did not like to say. But now I have. Damn.
416 | 715 | 714 | I am D'Astragaar, D'Astragaar, D'Astragaar. At your service.
417 | 597 | 596 | Whatever you say, sieur/dame.
418 | 527 | 526 | Hnn, whenever.
419 | 683 | 682 | Whenever sieur/dame likes.
420 | 517 | 516 | That is not a part of the ship that I frequent, sieur/dame.
421 | 523 | 522 | Where indeed, my friend, where indeed.
422 | 531 | 530 | Wherever.
423 | 535 | 534 | Where do you think?
424 | 681 | 680 | There, there, there, can't you see where I'm pointing ?
425 | 379 | 378 | This is the First Class Restaurant. Do you have a reservation?
426 | 383 | 382 | We are vairry busy tonight, sieur/dame. I do not know that we can squeeze you in.
427 | 381 | 380 | Tut tut tut. I think not, sieur/dame.
428 | 477 | 476 | I think it is currently serving M Scraliontis who lingers very greatly over his caf$!
429 | 483 | 482 | There are some naughty cylinders there, but to get a cylinder of Boppy Headcase, you must get it from Boppy!
430 | 795 | 794 | In the universe, my friend, in the universe.
431 | 475 | 474 | Sacre Vert! At the end of my arm!
432 | 701 | 700 | You will have to ask one of the other Bots. I do not concern myself with this tedious matters of geography.
433 | 703 | 702 | Ask another Bot, sieur/dame!
434 | 435 | 434 | He is not here. How should I know?
435 | 471 | 470 | It is here in my hand.
436 | 473 | 472 | Oh yes it is.
437 | 479 | 478 | It is in the lobby of the restaurant.
438 | 699 | 698 | The music room you will be able to reach via the Pellerator on the Second Class Canal.
439 | 797 | 796 | We await them, sieur/dame.
440 | 461 | 460 | I think it is highly distributed.
441 | 459 | 458 | It is, I think in the traditional place. On her neck!
442 | 457 | 456 | I think she is in her chambre.
443 | 845 | 844 | I would not know where to begin.
444 | 513 | 512 | You have put your little finger on the throbbing heart of the mystery, there, I think.
445 | 515 | 514 | I do not know, my friend, I do not know.
446 | 507 | 506 | Who indeed, my friend, who indeed!
447 | 377 | 376 | I am the Maitre d'Bot. I am at your service, very much so.
448 | 713 | 712 | I am your Maitre d'Bot here in the lovely lovely lovely restaurant for the first class passengers on the Starship Titanic.
449 | 697 | 696 | Boppy is the King of Bop! You will find him in the music room boogie-woogieing with his Laid-Back Loafers!
450 | 447 | 446 | M. Brobostigon is the manager of this great enterprise. He is a great man with a great girth!
451 | 423 | 422 | It was M. Leovinus. But I think it was a leetle accident. He was very stressed. I think he has a tiny disagreement with M. Scraliontis. But you do not wish to hear this, do you?
452 | 425 | 424 | Then I shall fight you!
453 | 427 | 426 | But sieur/dame, you mistake me for some person who is not the absolute soul of discretion! How can you think this of me? I will fight you!
454 | 353 | 352 | Our chef is a very brilliant but naughty man.
455 | 443 | 442 | You don't know who is M. Leovinus? Sacre vert! He is le grand fromage! Le camembert enorme! It is M. Leovinus who designed this ship!
456 | 509 | 508 | Speak to me of no parrot! I will not discuss this infernal bird!
457 | 445 | 444 | M. Scraliontis is the great counter of the beans! He is the chief accountant of the building of the Starship Titanic!
458 | 455 | 454 | Sacre vert! Titania is the essence of the ship! She is the one through whom flows all the intelligence of the ship, and she is, I think undone! Her head, I think, is in bits!
459 | 485 | 484 | He is in the music room, you fool!
460 | 511 | 510 | Why indeed, my friend, why indeed. Why is the sky blue? Why is the sea yellow? Why does my heart sing with delight whenever it hears the lyrical melodies of Boppy Headcase? Who can tell, my friend, these mysteries are not for us to know. Whatever.
461 | 519 | 518 | Why indeed, my friend, why indeed.
462 | 537 | 536 | Why do you ask?
463 | 539 | 538 | Why do you think?
464 | 355 | 354 | He does very naughty things with food. I think you will find it vairry delicious and naughty.
465 | 437 | 436 | I think M Scraliontis he was boiling his books!
466 | 793 | 792 | Emptiness is a state of mind, my friend.
467 | 453 | 452 | I think he does not like to find M Scraliontis waving around bits of Titania's brain, hnnn?
468 | 351 | 350 | Because it is such a nice menu! I love to talk of it! It is my hobby!
469 | 691 | 690 | Because I am a man of taste and discernment. I think this is clear.
470 | 569 | 568 | That is why I am the Maitre d'Bot.
471 | 1239 | 1238 | will be of assistance.
472 | 489 | 488 | Ai ai ai ai ai! That brain-twisting so-called music naughty sound is worse than what was on before! Take it off! Take it off!
473 | 491 | 490 | No no no! That is not music! That is like a lawn-mower in my intestines! Please take it off! Give me Boppy!
474 | 493 | 492 | Take it off! Take it off! Give me the music of Boppy!
475 | 495 | 494 | What have you done to Boppy's music! The bass is all wrong! This is worse than no Boppy!
476 | 497 | 496 | You have broken Boppy's tune in a naughty way! The bottleblower is all wrong! You have offended my ears vairry greatly!
477 | 499 | 498 | What have you done to Boppy? You have made Boppy play his part all wrong! Oh poor, poor Boppy! Poor poor me!
478 | 227 | 226 | Tres bien.
479 | 245 | 244 | I am altogether all over happy.
480 | 247 | 246 | It is of nothing.
481 | 249 | 248 | There is not a word.
482 | 251 | 250 | Ca va.
483 | 253 | 252 | Bien.
484 | 255 | 254 | Bien sur.
485 | 257 | 256 | Certainment.
486 | 259 | 258 | You say so, do you? But what do you do?
487 | 261 | 260 | You think so? I challenge your confiance!
488 | 263 | 262 | You say so? I spit on your compliance!
489 | 229 | 228 | Bon,
490 | 265 | 264 | You think so do you? Then have at you, you... person!
491 | 267 | 266 | Yes? You say so?
492 | 269 | 268 | Yes! I spit on your yes!
493 | 271 | 270 | Oui? I go like this at your affirmative rejoinder!
494 | 273 | 272 | Yes? But of course.
495 | 275 | 274 | Yes.
496 | 231 | 230 | Bon bon bon bon bon.
497 | 233 | 232 | Hnnn!
498 | 235 | 234 | Then let us accelerate ourselves here, mightily.
499 | 237 | 236 | I am therefore very happy. For the moment.
500 | 239 | 238 | You think so, hnnn?
501 | 241 | 240 | I am so happy to be of service.
502 | 243 | 242 | I am happiness altogether.
503 | 929 | 928 | Yes, and what fun it is.
504 | 927 | 926 | Yes, and what fun it was.
505 | 883 | 882 | Oh, yes, that's good.
506 | 869 | 868 | You amaze me very much.
507 | 411 | 410 | Just my little joke, sieur/dame. I think you are vairry amused.
508 | 875 | 874 | You are very clever.
509 | 785 | 784 | It is this terrible music. It makes me very tense.
510 | 395 | 394 | Aha! Aha! I have no menu. . Ha! Ha! Ha Ha! HaHaHaHaHa! First blood to me, I think.
511 | 859 | 858 | You think so?
512 | 1527 | 1526 | Absolument.
513 | 1783 | 1782 | You mock me, sieur/dame. I am a Maitre d'Bot.
514 | 1593 | 1592 | Ow!
515 | 1595 | 1594 | aiie!
516 | 1597 | 1596 | ouch!
517 | 1599 | 1598 | Please stop it!
518 | 1517 | 1516 | The bombe surprise is not a dish we favour in this restaurant, sieur/dame. I wish we could be rid of it.
519 | 1775 | 1774 | I think you are a little confused, sieur/dame. That is what I ask you.
520 | 1799 | 1798 | I can. But maybe I do not wish to. Had you considered that, my friend? Hein?
521 | 1801 | 1800 | I recommend some dishes.
522 | 1803 | 1802 | What dishes would you like me to recommend?
523 | 1453 | 1452 | I do not know. I do not care.
524 | 1807 | 1806 | Extreme naughtiness. So - he is dead.
525 | 1519 | 1518 | Chicken? Non, sieur/dame, our dishes favour ingredients un peu plus elev$ et distingu$.
526 | 1677 | 1676 | Aha!
527 | 1695 | 1694 | Zut!
528 | 1697 | 1696 | Die, cue!
529 | 1679 | 1678 | Aha!
530 | 1681 | 1680 | En garde!
531 | 1683 | 1682 | Have at you!
532 | 1685 | 1684 | Blaggard!
533 | 1687 | 1686 | Swish and swipe!
534 | 1689 | 1688 | Zounds!
535 | 1691 | 1690 | Swish and swipe!
536 | 1693 | 1692 | Oo!
537 | 1833 | 1832 | Enfin! Enough! You win the day! I submit the towel! I throw in the ghost! My white flag enlofts! I yield to your superior bottom-prodding strategies! So! I invite you to join Monsieur Scraliontis at his table. Bon Appetit!
538 | 1559 | 1558 | Desol$.
539 | 1625 | 1624 | I do not wish to know this.
540 | 1411 | 1410 | Perhaps I can render a leetle assistance by plying you with my lovely menu.
541 | 1413 | 1412 | Bien sur, I am enchant$ to help, if you are perhaps enchant$ to help me.
542 | 1629 | 1628 | Perhaps I can render a leetle assistance by plying you with my lovely menu.
543 | 1631 | 1630 | Bien sur, I am enchant$ to help, if you are perhaps enchant$ to help me.
544 | 1637 | 1636 | You? You ask me for help who has woefully prodded me in my Achilles buttock? I think not sieur/dame.
545 | 1549 | 1548 | Here and there.
546 | 1273 | 1272 | No, take it away! The bass playing person is out of tune!
547 | 1291 | 1290 | I think it is all too much for Boppy now. He just wants to get it over with as quickly as possible. What a terrible night for Boppy!
548 | 1293 | 1292 | I think the strain is telling on poor Boppy. I think he is slowing down. I hope this is not the end of his magnificent career!
549 | 1295 | 1294 | It's all getting a bit much for Boppy isn't it? He's not even playing at all now.
550 | 1297 | 1296 | Poor Boppy! I think he is a little down in the dumps, non? This is not like him at all!
551 | 1299 | 1298 | Ah, these music playing persons and their naughtiness! I think that Boppy is a little high, non?
552 | 1301 | 1300 | No! This is terrible! I mistrust that serpent! He is playing too fast!
553 | 1303 | 1302 | What a sad and terrible sound! I think it is that serpent sliding along too slow!
554 | 1305 | 1304 | Quelle cacophonie!
555 | 1307 | 1306 | Do you think that dear Boppy is well in himself?
556 | 1309 | 1308 | Do you think that the naughty Bass playing person is quite right?
557 | 1275 | 1274 | No, no! How can poor Boppy work in such conditions? The Bass playing person is a nincompoop!
558 | 1311 | 1310 | Do you think that the naughty serpent thing is quite right?
559 | 1313 | 1312 | It sounds not right to me!
560 | 1315 | 1314 | The bells, as normal, are comme il faut, but I am not sure about the others.
561 | 1333 | 1332 | It is better, but I'm still a bit worried about Boppy.
562 | 1335 | 1334 | It is better but I do not think that the Bass playing person is right yet.
563 | 1337 | 1336 | It is better but I do not like the sound of the serpent!
564 | 1339 | 1338 | Ah! That sounds a bit better. The Bass playing person is improving!
565 | 1341 | 1340 | It is a pity about Boppy, though.
566 | 1343 | 1342 | I do not like the sound of the serpent, though.
567 | 1345 | 1344 | At least the serpent is now correct!
568 | 1347 | 1346 | It is a pity about Boppy, though.
569 | 1349 | 1348 | It is a pity about the Bass playing person, though.
570 | 1351 | 1350 | Dieu merci! I had such great anxiety about Boppy, but he seems to be playing beautifully now, quite beautifully.
571 | 1353 | 1352 | It is a pity about the serpent, though.
572 | 1355 | 1354 | It is a pity about the Bass playing person, though.
573 | 1357 | 1356 | It still sounds as a cacophony, though. Poor Boppy! Quel dommage.
574 | 1277 | 1276 | This is terrible! Is the Bass playing person standing on his head?
575 | 1359 | 1358 | Quelle cacophonie! Poor Boppy!
576 | 1361 | 1360 | I so much hate this travesty of Boppy's music!
577 | 1363 | 1362 | Quelle cacophonie! Poor Boppy!
578 | 1365 | 1364 | Is there not a Bot in attendance who can assist you?
579 | 1367 | 1366 | By the music machine, no?
580 | 1369 | 1368 | You look at that serpent thing! Do you see any evidence of ears? Non! Do you hear any evidence of ears? I think not!
581 | 1371 | 1370 | That serpent! He makes squeak squeak noises, much too high!
582 | 1373 | 1372 | That damn serpent, he slinks around playing too low!
583 | 1375 | 1374 | You would not trust a serpent to know which way was up, would you!
584 | 1377 | 1376 | Our chef, he says it is difficult to tell one end of a serpent from the other. This serpent, he does not know one end of a tune from the other!
585 | 1279 | 1278 | What a cacophony! Do you think the bass is trying to get to the bar before the others? I cannot bear this noise!
586 | 1379 | 1378 | The bells player is a tower of the strength, non?
587 | 1381 | 1380 | Whatever else goes wrong, he is right. Of course, being the only one in step doesn't make you sound right!
588 | 1383 | 1382 | I think the player of the bells is in his own world, no?
589 | 1385 | 1384 | Always steady, always correct.
590 | 1387 | 1386 | Ah! The bells fall silent I see! The only one who never makes a mistake is silenced. Ah well, no good deed ever goes unpunished.
591 | 1389 | 1388 | And now we have no bells. That is a pity. At least the bells playing person was always correct.
592 | 1391 | 1390 | Getting better. Long way to go, but getting better.
593 | 1281 | 1280 | No, this is a travesty of Boppy! The Bass playing person is falling asleep!
594 | 1283 | 1282 | The Bass playing person has no respect for the music of Boppy! He plays back to front!
595 | 1285 | 1284 | I think the Bass playing person is sulking now. He's not bothering to play at all. It could be worse.
596 | 1287 | 1286 | Poor Boppy! what have you done to him! You have made him play back to front! You are philistine!
597 | 1289 | 1288 | Poor Boppy! Have you stood the maestro on his head! Shame on you!
598 | 1317 | 1316 | This pitch is too low.
599 | 1319 | 1318 | This pitch is too high.
600 | 1321 | 1320 | He plays his part upside down!
601 | 1323 | 1322 | He plays his part back to front?
602 | 1325 | 1324 | The tempo is all wrong!
603 | 1327 | 1326 | He plays trop vite!
604 | 1329 | 1328 | He plays a little slow, I think.
605 | 1331 | 1330 | He does not play at all!
606 | 1393 | 1392 | I am vairry, vairry, vairry happy, I am glad to say. Except of course for the music.
607 | 1251 | 1250 | Aha, You cannot, my fine friend. I am a fighting waiter in his prime.
608 | 1435 | 1434 | I think it would be vairry good, but I do not know if it is possible.
609 | 1437 | 1436 | By excelling.
610 | 1561 | 1560 | I do not know. I have no understanding of the technologie.
611 | 1563 | 1562 | I think this is a probleme that you will have to piece together yourself, sieur/dame.
612 | 1565 | 1564 | Perhaps it is a matter of the psychologie, non? Non.
613 | 1475 | 1474 | Humming.
614 | 1477 | 1476 | Humming.
615 | 1395 | 1394 | Ah, tant pis. Too bad.
616 | 1835 | 1834 | Tell me you submit!
617 | 1837 | 1836 | Tell me again!
618 | 1839 | 1838 | Tell me again with feeling!
619 | 1841 | 1840 | Oh. Fair enough. But you cannot have a table! Ha! I win.
620 | 1405 | 1404 | Alors. Bien. Tcchh.
621 | 1525 | 1524 | Immediatement.
622 | 1459 | 1458 | The only puzzle is how I remain sane with this atrocious music. Perhaps I do not, sieur/dame, perhaps I do not.
623 | 1495 | 1494 | Leovinus.
624 | 1259 | 1258 | No. There are wine lists on the tables! There are no menus!
625 | 1465 | 1464 | Mutter mutter.
626 | 1467 | 1466 | Mutter mutter.
627 | 1469 | 1468 | Mutter mutter.
628 | 1471 | 1470 | Mutter mutter.
629 | 1473 | 1472 | Mutter mutter.
630 | 1407 | 1406 | I have no reservation in that name. All our tables are occup$. Je suis desol$.
631 | 1409 | 1408 | What a strange name. I'm D'Astragaar.
632 | 1529 | 1528 | My pleasure.
633 | 1399 | 1398 | Enchante.
634 | 1401 | 1400 | Bien sur.
635 | 1397 | 1396 | A beautiful starry night. As always.
636 | 1705 | 1704 | Oh no he isn't.
637 | 1709 | 1708 | Oh no it doesn't.
638 | 1721 | 1720 | Doesn't doesn't doesn't doesn't.
639 | 1701 | 1700 | Oh no it isn't.
640 | 1717 | 1716 | Isn't isn't isn't isn't.
641 | 1741 | 1740 | This silence is terrible to me! It is like the emptiness of space! Play me the music of Boppy!
642 | 1743 | 1742 | My soul cannot endure this silence of no music! Let the music of Boppy soothe my spirit!
643 | 1745 | 1744 | Please! Spare me this terrible aching void of silence!
644 | 1747 | 1746 | I beg you bring me music! And not that awful naughty music, but the delightful music of Boppy!
645 | 1713 | 1712 | Oh no they don't.
646 | 1725 | 1724 | Don't don't don't don't.
647 | 1633 | 1632 | My ears are grossly besieged by this musique excecrable. Perhaps you can replace it with mellifluity?
648 | 1553 | 1552 | Oh, things.
649 | 1521 | 1520 | No chook.
650 | 1667 | 1666 | Aha! You wiggle your pointy thing! Have at you! Have at you vairry much indeed!
651 | 1669 | 1668 | You dare to wiggle your pointy thing at me! I fight you! En garde! Have at you!
652 | 1639 | 1638 | Aha! You retreat, non? I think you are a little cowardly so and so! I despise you vairry much for you do nothing!
653 | 1657 | 1656 | I say you fight me!
654 | 1659 | 1658 | Fight! Fight me! I insist!
655 | 1661 | 1660 | Fight me! I implore you! My manhood demands it! I never deny my manhood!
656 | 1663 | 1662 | You deny my manhood? If you will deny my manhood I will fight you!
657 | 1665 | 1664 | Please, pleeeeease fight! If you do not fight I feel vairry silly!
658 | 1641 | 1640 | You think to rest on your laurels, I think! Beware, sieur/dame for I go swish and swipe at your laurels! I am herbicide to your laurels!
659 | 1643 | 1642 | En garde! Fight me you cowardly not person!
660 | 1645 | 1644 | You think to overcome me with the masterly inactivity, non! I think this strategy will serve you vairry badly because you stink up my brain!
661 | 1647 | 1646 | So you think to defeat me with this doing nothing? I see through your doing nothing! I say that nothing will come of nothing! You are to me a nothing person!
662 | 1649 | 1648 | Laugh.
663 | 1651 | 1650 | You think to rest in the centre of the battle? You think perhaps some nice person bring you orange slices? I think not, sieur/dame, I think you must fight!
664 | 1653 | 1652 | Fight me, sieur/dame, fight me!
665 | 1655 | 1654 | Pick up your pointy thing and fight, damn you!
666 | 1671 | 1670 | Ah! You think to move your pointy thing away from me! This running awayness I despise! Come back here and wiggle that!
667 | 1673 | 1672 | You think you will escape me with your pointy thing! Return into the fray, return I say!
668 | 1675 | 1674 | Come back here with your pointy thing! Fight like a man that I may kill you like a dog!
669 | 1749 | 1748 | Have a care that you do not provoke me, sieur/dame, I do not wish that we become enemies over this matter.
670 | 1751 | 1750 | I ask you to exercise a little caution in what you say, sieur/dame. I do not wish to fight you.
671 | 1753 | 1752 | Do not make me fight you, sieur/dame.
672 | 1755 | 1754 | I do not wish to biff you in my restaurant, sieur/dame.
673 | 1757 | 1756 | Please adjust your manner to me sieur/dame, that we may not come to blows.
674 | 1759 | 1758 | I issue this warning. Do not molest me, that we may not come to swishing and swiping!
675 | 1761 | 1760 | You wish that we come to swishing and swiping? I think not! Desist therefore, naughty sieur/dame.
676 | 1627 | 1626 | The pur$e is off, today.
677 | 1619 | 1618 | You like the dance? You like the way in which I wiggle my hips? Non?
678 | 1617 | 1616 | If this interests you, you should pay a visit to Boppy.
679 | 1621 | 1620 | I am not a sailor.
680 | 1611 | 1610 | Science.
681 | 1613 | 1612 | I think I know this name. I think they have not paid their bill. It is enorme!
682 | 1609 | 1608 | If you will speak in this manner with me, I will be hot in the collar and will fight you!
683 | 1615 | 1614 | I do not read this book. It is written by a parrot.
684 | 1623 | 1622 | I am sorry, but my TLA server is down.
685 | 1785 | 1784 | Non, I am completely perfect. The music, however, is broken.
686 | 1765 | 1764 | We do not discuss the competition.
687 | 1523 | 1522 | Right away.
688 | 1533 | 1532 | It is right behind you.
689 | 1531 | 1530 | It is right here.
690 | 1557 | 1556 | Tant pis. Too bad.
691 | 1811 | 1810 | Oh yes. Zut. I forgot.
692 | 1733 | 1732 | Ouch! Please! That too is my arm!
693 | 1735 | 1734 | Menu, sieur/dame? What menu. I deny all knowledge of a menu.
694 | 1487 | 1486 | Atchoo...
695 | 1489 | 1488 | Atchoo...
696 | 1479 | 1478 | Snore.
697 | 1481 | 1480 | Snore.
698 | 1483 | 1482 | Snore.
699 | 1555 | 1554 | Some business I had to attend to.
700 | 1269 | 1268 | You think all is not perfect for you, my friend? You set yourself up as an arbiter of such matters do you, do you?
701 | 1601 | 1600 | Huh?
702 | 1603 | 1602 | Pardon?
703 | 1605 | 1604 | Say again?
704 | 1607 | 1606 | Repeat please!
705 | 1827 | 1826 | I think not, my friend. Monsieur Scraliontis lingairrs very much over his caf$. He is a true gastronome!
706 | 1727 | 1726 | That table is occup$.
707 | 1729 | 1728 | That table also is occup$.
708 | 1731 | 1730 | That table especially is occup$.
709 | 1423 | 1422 | I think you mistake me, sieur/dame. I am the Maitre d'Bot.
710 | 1537 | 1536 | Thank you.
711 | 1539 | 1538 | De rien.
712 | 1541 | 1540 | Mon plaisir.
713 | 1543 | 1542 | I am glad to be of the assistance.
714 | 1545 | 1544 | If there is anything else you wish you have only to ask.
715 | 1551 | 1550 | This and that.
716 | 1461 | 1460 | Hurr hun...
717 | 1463 | 1462 | Hurr hun...
718 | 1763 | 1762 | Starship Titanic - the boat which cannot probably turn badly.
719 | 1547 | 1546 | Up and down.
720 | 1445 | 1444 | I think it is a supernova. It is quite pretty, I think. Perhaps a little overdone.
721 | 1455 | 1454 | I have no need of such things. I am what I am.
722 | 1451 | 1450 | I know nothing of these. I am not as other Bots.
723 | 1805 | 1804 | The chef recommends the Chef's Speciality.
724 | 1457 | 1456 | You should be elegant and soign$, and you should enjoy the beautiful food and the beautiful view.
725 | 1439 | 1438 | Nothing. It is not my concern.
726 | 1773 | 1772 | Our renown, sieur/dame.
727 | 1415 | 1414 | There was un petit fracas. A little disagreement, I think, over some minor matters. Monsieur Leovinus was a little exercised, I think. And Monsieur Scraliontis was not at his best. But I am the Maitre d'Bot. I do not gossip, you understand.
728 | 1789 | 1788 | It is Titania's Auditory Center, of course. I just happen to have it about my person.
729 | 1737 | 1736 | We are lost in space. The robots are out of control. The ship's cyberintelligence is in pieces. I could cope with it if it wasn't for this terrible silence!
730 | 1403 | 1402 | I am the Maitre d'Bot. I am witty and charming and a purveyor of menus.
731 | 1431 | 1430 | If we are lost, we are lost. It is a matter of indifference to me.
732 | 1793 | 1792 | I love the mellifluous musical stylings of Boppy Headcase and his Laid-Back Loafers. It is the music I adore!
733 | 1771 | 1770 | Our famousness, of course.
734 | 1797 | 1796 | Everything, sieur/dame. Every dish, every table, every tiniest detail is special.
735 | 1491 | 1490 | Nothing you should concern yourself with.
736 | 1567 | 1566 | Time to look at the menu, perhaps?
737 | 1569 | 1568 | Dinner time.
738 | 1791 | 1790 | I hardly know where to begin. It is an offence to the ears! It is a foul and nasty clattering sound! It is audible piffle!
739 | 1433 | 1432 | I think her head is in bits. It is vairry bad for her.
740 | 1571 | 1570 | Never.
741 | 1573 | 1572 | Immediatement.
742 | 1575 | 1574 | Right away.
743 | 1577 | 1576 | Soon.
744 | 1579 | 1578 | Later.
745 | 1581 | 1580 | Earlier.
746 | 1583 | 1582 | Just missed it.
747 | 1585 | 1584 | Perhaps you should hurry.
748 | 1587 | 1586 | Whenever you like.
749 | 1253 | 1252 | This is the First Class Restaurant, sieur/dame, as is extremely evident, I think.
750 | 1429 | 1428 | It is outside the restaurant. That is all.
751 | 1591 | 1590 | The bar.
752 | 1589 | 1588 | You are in the finest restaurant in the galaxy. Where else would you wish to go?
753 | 1417 | 1416 | Blerontin.
754 | 1427 | 1426 | Where we come from, where we go, is of no matter to me. I am concerned only with the gastronomie, the etiquette, and the swishing and swiping.
755 | 1535 | 1534 | You're standing in it, you fool.
756 | 1421 | 1420 | You go out of the restaurant. After that, I do not care.
757 | 1257 | 1256 | Where is what menu? Where is the menu that does not exist? How can I answer such a question?
758 | 1795 | 1794 | There is no menu.
759 | 1419 | 1418 | I do not know. It is not a matter with which I concern myself.
760 | 1441 | 1440 | Everybody who is not inside my restaurant is outside my restaurant and therefore of no concern to me, sieur/dame.
761 | 1443 | 1442 | I cannot tell you. It is of no concern to me.
762 | 1425 | 1424 | I do not wish to speak of matters of the bottom, sieur/dame.
763 | 1769 | 1768 | We expect many, many guests. We are fully booked, of course. We are a very renowned restaurant.
764 | 1497 | 1496 | Brobostigon.
765 | 1447 | 1446 | Monsieur Leovinus, the great genius.
766 | 1515 | 1514 | D'Astragaar.
767 | 1511 | 1510 | Fentible.
768 | 1509 | 1508 | Fortillian.
769 | 1819 | 1818 | The great Monsieur Leovinus.
770 | 1501 | 1500 | The Gat.
771 | 1507 | 1506 | Krage.
772 | 1513 | 1512 | Marsinta.
773 | 1503 | 1502 | Me.
774 | 1499 | 1498 | Scraliontis.
775 | 1493 | 1492 | Titania.
776 | 1449 | 1448 | The company is Starlight Lines, sieur/dame.
777 | 1505 | 1504 | You.
778 | 1809 | 1808 | He was too naughty to live.
779 | 1825 | 1824 | You must ask Monsieur Scraliontis.
780 | 1271 | 1270 | You think I like this music! Ptah! I despise it!
781 | 1261 | 1260 | Because of the chef. He is vairry naughty.
782 | 1263 | 1262 | Because I am the Maitre d'Bot! It is my job to offer you the menu, sieur/dame! You would deny me my livelihood?
783 | 1267 | 1266 | Then do not impugn me my menu offering qualities, my friend!
784 | 1265 | 1264 | Then I will fight you!
785 | 1255 | 1254 | Because I am menuless. I am devoid of menus. Le menu? Il n'existe pas.
786 | 1767 | 1766 | I think sieur/dame has not been to many fine restaurants, huh? that you ask such a question.
787 | 1635 | 1634 | I desire the melodies of Boppy! Please to bring them!
788 | 1485 | 1484 | Yawn.
789 | 1703 | 1702 | Oh yes he is.
790 | 1777 | 1776 | Yes I did...
791 | 1779 | 1778 | Yes I did, yes I did...
792 | 1781 | 1780 | I did!
793 | 1707 | 1706 | Oh yes it does.
794 | 1719 | 1718 | Does does does and does.
795 | 1699 | 1698 | Oh yes it is.
796 | 1715 | 1714 | Is is is and is.
797 | 1711 | 1710 | Oh yes they do.
798 | 1723 | 1722 | Do do do and do.
799 | 1787 | 1786 | Ha ha! Sieur/dame's little joke. Let us turn out attention to other matters. Like this terrible music which renders me so distrait!
800 | 1829 | 1828 | I deny that! I deny that utterly!
801 | 1813 | 1812 | I enjoy all fineries of the table.
802 | 1739 | 1738 | It is the frightful emptiness of the silence! It makes me vairry tense.
803 | 1831 | 1830 | You say so, hein? Then I will fight you!
804 | 1823 | 1822 | But I have a rapier wit, no? I shall foil you! You shall see!
805 | 1815 | 1814 | According to Leovinus, he eats just desserts.
806 | 1821 | 1820 | You think so? You try me and soon you shall see!
807 | 1817 | 1816 | You dare to ask this? I think you should ask the great Monsieur Leovinus, my friend!
808 | 11 | 10 | Ah, if it were only possible, sieur/dame. Sadly I seem to have temporarily mislaid the key to the music playing system. It makes me vairry tense, of course, but, I hope we can be friends.
809 | 23 | 22 | I do not wish to speak of this Parrot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
810 | 25 | 24 | I do not wish to speak of this BellBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
811 | 27 | 26 | I do not wish to speak of this BarBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
812 | 29 | 28 | I do not wish to speak of this LiftBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
813 | 31 | 30 | I do not wish to speak of this Titania. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
814 | 33 | 32 | I do not wish to speak of this DeskBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
815 | 35 | 34 | I do not wish to speak of this DoorBot. It makes me vairry tense. Let us speak instead of the delights of our menu.
816 | 163 | 162 | It is a little late for for en garde! I think you now run away!
817 | 1 | 0 | Welcome to the most glamorous dining experience in the whole galaxy, sieur/dame. May I apologize for the music?
818 | 3 | 2 | Bonsoir, bienvenue it is a joy beyond comprehension to greet you tonight sieur/dame or other. I hope that the music will not make you vomit unduly.
819 | 5 | 4 | I must say sieur/dame or other looking more exquisite than I can muster words to express tonight. The music I must apologize for. It is a distress to me.
820 | 7 | 6 | You are, if I may say so, looking ineffably elegant tonight. Very delicious, very soign$. I wish that the music was more suitable to receive you. I hate it very much.
821 | 93 | 92 | Aha! I have the advantage of you I think!
822 | 95 | 94 | A hit! A very palpable hit!
823 | 113 | 112 | Zounds, that smarts!
824 | 115 | 114 | Oh! Be gentle with me! Aha! Now I have you! Never trust a fighting waiter in his prime!
825 | 117 | 116 | You will die here! Here! Here on my very own hearthrug!
826 | 119 | 118 | Vous etes les testicules d'un cochon! I pinch you very hard between my forefingers! I bite you very much!
827 | 121 | 120 | Ah! You are flagging now! You wilt very much indeed! I press home my advantage indeed! Ouch!
828 | 123 | 122 | You fight with a man who fights many times! I am fighting two times already today! You have to be very fit in these days to run a restaurant!
829 | 125 | 124 | Garcons! Garcons! Assistance if you please! Aux arms! Run this blaggard through, sirs, if you please!
830 | 127 | 126 | I die! I die! I expire! No! I'm better again! Have at you! An old trick but it might just work!
831 | 129 | 128 | Ah! You have a stick! Have at you and your stick! I despise your stick very much!
832 | 131 | 130 | Ah! You have a hammer! Have at you and your hammer! I despise your hammer very much!
833 | 133 | 132 | Ah! You have a lemon! Have at you and your lemon! I despise your lemon very much!
834 | 135 | 134 | Ah! You have a chicken! Have at you and your chicken! I despise your chicken very much!
835 | 137 | 136 | Ah! You have a parrot's perch! Have at you and your parrot's perch! I despise your parrot's perch very much!
836 | 139 | 138 | My body outnumbers you!
837 | 97 | 96 | A hit! A very palatable hit!
838 | 141 | 140 | Ha! I penetrate deeply your defences!
839 | 143 | 142 | My driving force propels me forward! I lunge! I engage! I recover from my lunge!
840 | 145 | 144 | You compete with a person at the peak of his flexion and elasticity!
841 | 147 | 146 | Your cause is lost! I make forays in your fertile country!
842 | 149 | 148 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your stick!
843 | 151 | 150 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your hammer!
844 | 153 | 152 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your lemon!
845 | 155 | 154 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your chicken!
846 | 157 | 156 | Beware! I bring you into danger! Even with your parrot's perch!
847 | 159 | 158 | I thrust! I lunge! I display no snail-like wiggling!
848 | 99 | 98 | Submit! Submit!
849 | 101 | 100 | Touch$!
850 | 103 | 102 | Touch$!
851 | 105 | 104 | Take that, that and that! And this also!
852 | 107 | 106 | Have a care, sieur/dame, for I fight very very dirty! I spit and fart and soil myself!
853 | 109 | 108 | Ouch! Ah! Oo!
854 | 111 | 110 | Oof! You are hurting me!
855 | 161 | 160 | And have at you too my fine friend!
856 | 61 | 60 | Dead? I think it is not possible, sieur/dame. Monsieur enjoys a digestive pause. He is a man of the greatest delicacy if not the greatest... vitesse of the payment. He lingers vairry much with his caf$.
857 | 63 | 62 | You think we poison our customers? You think we are a restaurant that wishes to assassinate its esteemed clientele? I think not! If you will say such a thing I will fight you!
858 | 65 | 64 | Then have at you you lying pighound! En garde!
859 | 225 | 224 | I will fight you! I will fight you!
860 | 47 | 46 | I will fetch it for you at once, sieur/dame. I will be just one leetle second, no more!
861 | 9 | 8 | A moment while I consult, sieur/dame. Alors, I find that, inadvertently we have no table reserved for you. I am extremely desolated at this oversight sieur/dame. However, I think we can juuuuuuuust squeeze you in. Damn this music, I hate it so much, excuse my frank.
862 | 205 | 204 | No, you must not play this music! It is an agony of the ears this music concrete. It is the music of the cement mixer! Bring me the mellifluous melodies of Boppy.
863 | 207 | 206 | Not this music! No! I think this is the wall of sound music, but it is a wall against which many people perhaps have excused themselves!
864 | 209 | 208 | Ohhhhh. This is so wonderful. I feel so relaxed.
865 | 211 | 210 | Play it to me, Boppy! It is so lovely and so languorous!
866 | 213 | 212 | I am tossed like a salad on the gentle waves of the melody! It is vairry fine this music!
867 | 215 | 214 | You know, everything on the ship is so shiny. It's twinkling like fairyland.
868 | 217 | 216 | I am transported on a souffle of sound. All is wonderment!.
869 | 219 | 218 | Boy, the ceiling looks reeeeely great from down here.
870 | 221 | 220 | I think maybe I'll have a little snooze. Wake me up for breakfast won't you...
871 | 195 | 194 | Ouch. Please. That too is my arm.
872 | 197 | 196 | If you will derange my arm I will fight you!
873 | 193 | 192 | You do not arouse me. You are boring to me now. Excuse me, now I prefer to hum. Hum her hum hum hum hum hummm her hum...
874 | 85 | 84 | Please, sieur/dame, do not prod me.
875 | 87 | 86 | I say again, do not prod me.
876 | 89 | 88 | Alright. I fight you!
877 | 91 | 90 | Have at you!
878 | 173 | 172 | Ah! You prod me on my Achilles buttock! This you must not do! It pains me vairry much!
879 | 177 | 176 | Do not prod my Achilles buttock!
880 | 179 | 178 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny stick!
881 | 181 | 180 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny hammer!
882 | 183 | 182 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny lemon!
883 | 185 | 184 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny chicken!
884 | 187 | 186 | My Achilles buttock! Prod it not with your puny parrot's perch!
885 | 189 | 188 | If you will prod my Achilles buttock you will compel me to give up!
886 | 191 | 190 | I will not fight further! I will not deign to fight one who prods the Achilles buttock! Instead I will sulk vairry much!
887 | 171 | 170 | Ah! You think to prod me on my Achilles heel! You think wrong my fine friend! I fight with renewed vigor!
888 | 199 | 198 | This thing you must not take! I will guard it fiercely for M Scraliontis while he lingers vairry much over his caf$!
889 | 201 | 200 | I resist you vairry strongly! You must not take this thing or I will fight you!
890 | 203 | 202 | Then have at you, you cup of a toad's vitals!
891 | 37 | 36 | Excellent! Excellent! This is more fabulous than I can easily express. And now perhaps we can discuss the lovely menu?
892 | 39 | 38 | But sieur/dame is so incandescently witty tonight! Let us shine your witty light on tonight's menu.
893 | 41 | 40 | Ah sieur/dame always knows what to say. Perhaps if I can insert a tiny word through the side, that tiny word would be menu!
894 | 43 | 42 | Your responses ravish me, sieur/dame, and makes me think that perhaps I ravish you back with my little menu?
895 | 45 | 44 | Sieur/dame, I am enchanted with our little chit chat, but if we do not consider the menu soon perhaps I will twist your head off, no?
896 | 167 | 166 | I will never surrender! Never! Unless... No! I will never surrender!
897 | 73 | 72 | But veritably we are sieur/dame, we are vairry, vairry busy and if you say we are not, I will fight you.
898 | 81 | 80 | Last chance to be escorted to your table, sieur/dame? No?
899 | 75 | 74 | No? Then I will fight you! I will! Have at you! En guard you puny biped!
900 | 83 | 82 | Now are you ready for your table? No? Then take that!
901 | 71 | 70 | Sadly, sieur/dame, we are vairry busy tonight and the other tables are all reserved.
902 | 77 | 76 | You let me show you to your table now? No?
903 | 79 | 78 | I show you to your table? Yes? No?
904 | 53 | 52 | We've got a very special table for you which will be ready just as soon as our previous customer has finished his coffee. He has been there seventeen hours so I am sure he will be calling for the bill in one second.
905 | 223 | 222 | Take it, take it. It is a burden to me! My soul floats on wings of melody and I do not wish to grapple with bits of brain!
906 | 49 | 48 | Please do not disturb me while I fetch the menu, sieur/dame! I will be just one leetle second, no more!
907 | 51 | 50 | That has inflamed your taste buds, I think! Allow me to show you to your table. I think you will find it most elegant and delightful.
908 | 165 | 164 | I think not touch$ my fine friend! I think I have you on the run!
909 | 169 | 168 | Unless nothing! I will never surrender! I am invincible! I have no Achilles heel!
910 | 67 | 66 | It is vairry strange! He enters our delightful restaurant last night carrying this... thing in his hand.
911 | 69 | 68 | And then there comes the great Monsieur Leovinus. He is not, I think, in a good mood, and he shouts very much. So I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is in a bad mood still, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is in a bad mood still, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he rips my arm off - poof! - and throws me to the ground, and I am vairry smooth and charming to him, and he is, I think, much moved and rips my head off, and then I am only a little bit conscious, but I think that they fight a little with my body parts. And then when I awake Monsieur Scraliontis is lingering vairry much over his coffee.
912 | 59 | 58 | He lingers! He lingers vairry strongly! Is the highest compliment to our chef!
913 | 13 | 12 | I do not wish to discuss the whereabouts of the key. It makes me vairry tense.
914 | 15 | 14 | I hope we will not become enemies over the matter of this key, my friend. I give you one more chance not to mention it.
915 | 17 | 16 | So! I fight you!
916 | 19 | 18 | What? And forfeit the element of surprise? You insult me to suggest I am so stupid!
917 | 21 | 20 | Do not jaw jaw me. I war war you!
918 | 57 | 56 | M. Scraliontis is le Comptroller! The Chef of Accountancy for the Starship Titanic. Is a vairry important man. It is a pity he does not pay his staff perhaps as often as is proper, but he is a man of the most exquisite taste. He has lingered over his coffee for seventeen hours!
919 | 55 | 54 | This is our vairry esteemed client and patron M. Scraliontis. He lingers a leetle over his meal, no? Is a man of refined tastes I think.
920 | 175 | 174 | You must not prod me on my Achilles buttock! It is vairry unfair that I cannot wiggle it away!
